The COPS borehole and water tank project, established in April, has assisted 22 needy beneficiary organisations and 12 under-resourced public schools in saving water and cutting down water costs. The borehole project received funding from the National Lotteries Commission and made it possible for over 12 000 pupils from the city’s schools to access water, and also able to help old age homes, orphanages and facilities for the mentally handicapped save 600 000 litres of water a month. The schools receiving the installation of the borehole and filtration systems include Scottsdene High, Wallacedene High, Rosendale High, Samora Machel Primary, Noxolo Xauka Primary and Blackheath Primary. Hylton Mitchell of COPS said: “The project is very labour intensive and we employed local small businesses to do the geological survey for water. The plumbing contractor we secured from Khayelitsha to allow smaller black-owned businesses to benefit.” The Homestead in Khayelitsha is one of the many organisations that the borehole project has assisted in providing alternative water sources. Homestead shelter director Paul Hooper said the borehole project was a brilliant initiative.  miche.edwards@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

One of the main suspects is DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, who was one of the candidates considered for the premier position. The investigation is being led by DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach, the chairperson of the party’s federal legal commission. Madikizela said: “I am always on record when I speak to the media. This everyone knows. I will not be handing over any cellphone or communication device. While I am fully contributing to this investigation I believe that there are more serious issues, like focusing on the elections.” A week ago, Maimane announced his nomination, but later withdrew it and announced the Western Cape MEC for Economic Opportunities, Alan Winde, as the party’s premier candidate. Madikizela was the only senior DA official who was strongly against Maimane’s decision. “I speak my mind on issues that don’t sit well with me I don’t know what the outcome will be of this investigation, and, quite frankly, it doesn’t matter. I have nothing to hide. We should be more focused on the elections to ensure that we stay in power here in the Western Cape.” Breytenbach said that she was leading an investigation into the matter. However, she referred all queries to the party’s federal executive. DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi said: “The federal executive has been consistently concerned about the leaking of confidential information from meetings. “Given that there was leaking of the scores and ranking of candidates for the Western Cape premier, which had a serious impact on our internal processes, the federal executive asked the federal legal commission to institute an investigation.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

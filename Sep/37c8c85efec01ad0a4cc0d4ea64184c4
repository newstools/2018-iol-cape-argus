Taariq Phillips, 23, and his 21-year-old girlfriend, Sharisha Chauhan, attended a rave in 2013 at Le Bac in Paarl. It was alleged that at about midnight, Phillips, Chauhan and some friends took drugs and went dancing. A short while later, Chauhan felt sick and went to rest in a tent with Phillips. About an hour later, the accused called for help as Chauhan began having seizures. It was initially believed that Chauhan died of a drug overdose, but an autopsy report said she was strangled to death. On Wednesday, Western Cape High Court judge Lee Bozalek said there was no direct evidence that Chauhan was strangled. He said she was a willing participant in taking MDMA (ecstasy), and the symptoms she had were experienced by her friends who had also taken the drug. However, the court found the State managed to prove its prima facie (circumstantial) case that Chauhan was raped anally and vaginally. According to the evidence of State forensic pathologist, Dr Deidre Abrahams, the court found Chauhan sustained vaginal tears and anal injuries. The expert for the defence, forensic pathologist Dr Steve Naidoo, said the vaginal tears could have been sustained during the biopsy examination. He said other injuries could be as a result of Chauhan masturbating. Judge Bozalek said he found Naidoo’s evidence anything but impartial. The court also questioned Phillips’s failure to testify as he was the only person who could explain the injuries, and offer an explanation for what took place in the tent. Phillips’s bail has been extended, but increased from R2 000 to R5 000. Sentencing will begin on October 29. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

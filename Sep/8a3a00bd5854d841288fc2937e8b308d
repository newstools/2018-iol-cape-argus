Recent wet weather has raised dam levels by 0.9% over the past week to 70% of storage capacity and, with more rain expected over the next two days, should rise even further this week. The average water consumption for the past week fell from 526 million litres per day to 505 million litres per day, the City of Cape Town announced. Last week, the City said it would lower water restrictions and tariffs from Level 6 to Level 5 from October 1 due to the encouraging dam recovery and the ongoing conservation efforts by Capetonians. As usage has never reached the target of 450 million under Level 6b - restrictions have hovered at about 500million litres a day which was the target for Level 5 restrictions - the City decided to lower the restriction and tariff to Level 5. This would provide some financial relief to water users and should reflect in next month’s municipal accounts. The City reiterated Level 5 restriction don’ts:  @TheCapeArgus argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

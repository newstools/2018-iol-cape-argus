“The concept of World Homeless Day emerged from online discussions between people working to respond to homelessness from various parts of the world. The purpose of World Homeless Day is to draw attention to homeless people’s needs locally and provide opportunities for the community to get involved in responding to homelessness, while taking advantage of the stage an ‘international day’ provides,” the organisation said. In Cape Town the homeless population is about 7 700. “The Carpenter’s Shop aims to be a point of contact for people to have access to a trusted social care team through providing needed services such as daily ablutions, toilet and laundry facilities, access to nutritional meals (through partnerships with other organisations), social work services, a monthly wellness clinic, life skills teaching and short-term second phase shelter accommodation (for vulnerable employed men). “Through engagement with our clients, we are able to better assist them with the aim of helping them to be reunited with their families, reintegrated into society through employment, or, where needed, to refer people to organisations equipped to assist with their long-term needs”. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

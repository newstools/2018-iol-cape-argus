Flying squad members spotted a BMW that had been hijacked in Diep River last month. They blocked off the vehicle, but then the suspect tried to get away. “In an attempt to flee, the hijacked vehicle collided with another vehicle and overturned,” police spokesperson Andrè Traut said. A 30-year-old man was arrested for being in possession of a hijacked vehicle, and would appear in court soon. Minutes after the crash, pictures and a video went viral on social media. Traffic was held up on both roads, and hours later police were still at the scene. The Western Cape gang watch posted a witness’s response on Facebook. “I was almost caught in crossfire now. Saw a real live shooting. Still trembling a little, waiting outside R school now. Happened at robot of Kromboom and Jan Smuts. I just saw (a) police van and a car stopping and then they were shooting at guys. I think they got them. I turned around immediately and came down Lawson Rd. Otherwise I would have been stuck in that traffic.” On Saturday at a roadblock in Rondebosch, an inspector was knocked down in a hit and run. The vehicle pulled out of traffic and raced through the roadblock, colliding with the inspector, who was later taken to the Melomed Hospital in Tokai. The inspector was treated for minor injuries and was discharged the next day. the Mayco member for safety and security, and social services, JP Smith, said driving under the influence of alcohol continued to be a severe social problem in the city. With various safe commuting options available to motorists, it was hard to comprehend how motorists continued to place their lives and those of others at risk, he said. Smith said 70 motorists had been arrested for drunken driving. The arrests were made in Strand, Bellville South, Fish Hoek, Diep River, Wynberg, Rondebosch, Claremont and Mitchells Plain. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

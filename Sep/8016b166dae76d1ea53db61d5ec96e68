Dr Abdul Kader Domingo, a member of the SA Society of Psychiatrist (Sasop) special group on addictions, said one in six teenagers would become addicted to cannabis. Domingo said according to research, 9% of individuals who experiment with cannabis will become addicted. He said this increases to one in six when use starts during adolescence. Domingo was responding to the recent Constitutional Court ruling that will be passed for the legalisation of cannabis for personal use. “Human brain development and maturation is a process that is guided by the body’s endogenous cannabinoid system and occurs until the early 20s. Exposure to phytocannabinoids (cannabinoids obtained from the cannabis plant) during this vulnerable period may disrupt the process of brain maturation and affect aspects of memory, attention, processing speed and overall intelligence. “Cannabis use during the adolescent period may cause lasting cognitive deficits, even after sustained abstinence.” Domingo referred to a 2016 SA Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use report that concluded that cannabis was the most common primary substance of abuse for people younger than 20 present at treatment facilities countrywide, except for Free State, Northern Cape and North West. Meanwhile, the SA Institute of Race Relations has welcomed the Concourt ruling. “People should be free to decide without interference from the state whether or not to use a substance such as cannabis in the privacy of their own home, in the same way as they can choose whether or not to consume alcohol at home. This right is legitimately restricted only when it impinges on others, such as by driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

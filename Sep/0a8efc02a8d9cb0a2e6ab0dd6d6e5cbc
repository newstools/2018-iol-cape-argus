The two schools were invited to the Independent Media offices yesterday for the handover of the bursaries. “Community Chest is celebrating our 90th anniversary and our primary area of investment is to ensure the future of the youth of the country. “The quiz is an exciting opportunity for the youth to engage academically,” said Community Chest chief executive officer Lorenzo Davids. “To allow them the means to pursue studying beyond matric and we thought it was important for us to show our support. Najuma Parker from Community Chest marketing said: “We have a love for education and the future of our youth, so when we saw the opportunity, we had to get involved.” Parker explained that the bursaries were split so that each of the two pupils from Mondale High School and The Leadership College will each get R35000 towards their tertiary education. The pupils will be able to pursue any field of study they want. Deputy principal for Mondale High School Nigel Crowie said: “It is a massive thing for the pupils to participate in the quiz. “The Mitchells Plain community has so much potential, but one of the things holding them back is the financial support. These bursaries will be making a change in the live of two pupils and we won’t realise what it means for the group below them.” South Peninsula High School and Steenberg High School Team A are to compete in the National High School Quiz on September 27. The contest will be held in Johannesburg at the Varsity College Sandton Campus. The national champions will win R20000 for the school, R5000 for each team member and R5000 for their educator or coach. @thelionmutters  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

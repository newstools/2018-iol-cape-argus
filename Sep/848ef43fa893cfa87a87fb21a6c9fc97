Last year, the Big Bash show celebrated its 10th anniversary with a sold-out performance. The performance will tell the story of how the Cape Culture Collective has evolved, through poetry, music and dance. The Cape Cultural Collective will be hosting the show on September 24 at 7.30pm. Tickets are R100 and can be purchased at Computicket. The artists to be featured are Jill Levenberg from the famous Suidooster and the Ellen Pakkies film; Don Vino Prins, who is one of Cape Town's prominent saxophonists; the Rosa choir; the Gentlemen's Ensemble, the talented opera conductors; Blackroots Marimba; the fiery dancers of Likhwezi Arts Project; poet Khadija Heeger; Unmute; drag artist Manila von Teez; Azanian Aesthetics; and hip hop group In the Key of B.   The Big Bash was directed by Shihaam Domingo, and Dillon April was the musical director. The Cape Cultural Collective was established by a group of former anti-apartheid activists and post-apartheid poets. The Cape Cultural Collective will be sponsored by the Foundation for Human Rights, which will fund six human rights events across Cape Town. Workshops in Bonteheuwel and Tambo Village have already been funded. The show will embrace all the languages and behaviours of our cultural heritage. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

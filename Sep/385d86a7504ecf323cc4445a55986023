The college is a non-profit organisation in Cape Town that aims to create social empowerment through teaching magic. The students will take part in an educational tour from October 2 to 16. The team comprises Sesona Gagana, 15, from Khayelitsha, Liam Hewitson, 15, from Bergvliet, Emma Hutchison, 16, from Claremont, Sahil Samlal, 16, from Century City, Duncan Shelver, 16, from Bellville and Anela Gazi, 18, from Mfuleni. The teens will meet distinguished magicians, including Penn & Teller, David Copperfield and Terry Fator. Yolandi van Jaarsveldt, chief executive of the college said: “To travel to the US is every magicians dream. This is an awesome opportunity for our students to learn a new culture and experience the broader world of magic.”   Through performances and the online Go-Get funding campaign, the college aims to reach R100 000 to help the students with their costs. The campaign is being led by Nyaniso Tutu-Burris, ambassador of the College of Magic and grandchild of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu.

Maimane said the preparation for the future is already taking shape in Delft at the Zoe Incubation Centre. “I think it is preparing itself for the future. “This is an incredible reminder of the progress we are making. This is a development that is creating jobs. “I am incredibly proud that this is here in Delft. It is a township. This is a community, and the plans here can be used everywhere else in the country,” he said. Software company ZaiLab have partnered with the Zoe Incubation Centre, which is run out of the Home of Compassion in Delft, to construct a call centre and training facility to create jobs for the community. Charles George, of the Home of Compassion Centre, said the call centre industry was one of the main contributors of jobs in the country but was mainly located in CBDs with employees having to travel long distances to get to work. The centre has 60 computer terminals for training and work. It also features a device that looks more like a microwave but the machine is a steriliser for the headsets worn by the agents. The long-term goals of the centre is to create more jobs through the expansion of the centre. George said the traditional business model of a contact centre is for a company to come in and buy a certain amount of seats in the centre, which means the company would pay for those seats to be contracted to them and man their call centre operations. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

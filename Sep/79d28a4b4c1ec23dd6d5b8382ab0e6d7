The event, if awarded, would be an historic first for the sport in the country and Africa. Netball SA is in the process of bidding to host the cup, and the City wants authority from the council to support the event if the bid is successful. On June 20, a meeting was held in Pretoria where City officials met with officials from national and provincial departments of sport and Netball SA. It was agreed that the City provide R6m for the event if the bid is successful. If the bid is successful, the City will provide value in kind including services and venues for the event, and City officials will form part of the planning committee. The Cape Town mayor will also issue a letter of support. According to a report by City safety and security director Richard Bosman and chief financial officer Kevin Jacoby, the event budget is R68 000 000, and if the bid is successful, the event will be hosted at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) in July 2023. The competition will take place over 10 days and 16 nations will compete for the World Cup title. The event organiser will make use of the exhibition halls at the venue which will be adapted to the event specifications. “Currently, this is the only suitable venue as the City of Cape Town does not have an indoor sporting facility that can accommodate a minimum of 5000 seats as per the event specifications. The CTICC is also favourable as it is a world-class facility, all the hotels and amenities are within walking distance and the City would save costs in terms of City services requirement,” the report reads. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The full moon spring tide started on Tuesday and lasts until Friday. This can result in stronger currents. The NSRI advises that beach-goers, coastal hikers and anglers must be extra careful. At Monwabisi Beach on Monday afternoon, a 29-year-old man drowned while another male was rescued when they were caught up in rip currents. At Milnerton lagoon beach, a young man drowned due to strong currents after an unsuccessful attempt by a lifesaver to save him. Another male aged 22 from Belhar was helped ashore by an NSRI member and a local surfer, Chris Poseman, when he got into difficulty. Reports of drownings at beaches in the Western Cape changes and fluctuates regularly, said Craig Lambinon, Sea Rescue Communications chief. The NSRI urged parents to be extra vigilant of their children. “We encourage beach-goers to adopt a safety conscious approach to recreational boating and bathing. Choose to visit a beach that has lifeguards on duty. If there are no lifeguards on duty do not swim,” said Lambinon. Lifeguards will be on duty every day during the school holidays from 10am until 6pm at Big Bay, Blue Waters, Camps Bay, Clifton, Danger Beach, Fish Hoek, Gordon’s Bay, Harmony Park, Hout Bay, Kogel Bay, Llandudno, Macassar, Melkbosstrand, Milnerton, Mnandi, Monwabisi, Muizenberg, Silwerstroom, Strand, Strandfontein and Sunrise Beach.

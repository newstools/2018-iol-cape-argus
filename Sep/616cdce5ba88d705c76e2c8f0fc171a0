This campaign is to help raise awareness among the public and to acknowledge those living with any type of cancer. The registry is internationally known and is currently the only organisation in Africa supporting an active matched donor transplant programme. The SABMR team consists of a group of highly trained individuals who deliver the necessary medical services to patients in need of bone marrow transplants. For those who would like to become donors, a recruitment officer will guide you through the process, providing you with the relevant information and testing kits. People are encouraged to help support those in need of stem cell donations and bone marrow transplants. The Masjidul Quds Institute will launch a #31Heroes campaign on social media to portray how the community has made a difference in the lives of patients, and will commemorate those who suffer from cancer. It will start from September 21 and a gala breakfast will take place on October 21. The #31Heroes will be introduced at the event and more information will be shared about the SABMR. To join the registry or make a donation, see www.sabmr.co.za, call (021) 4478638 or email donors@sabmr.co.za. @TheCapeArgus  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

 Cape Town - Scalp micropigmentation (SMP) is a medical-grade tattoo to give the appearance of stubble on one’s scalp. Whether it’s from afar or close up, the results are impressive - it looks as natural as it would had you simply cropped your hair very close to the skin. While there are many practitioners in the Western Cape, you should be cautious when choosing the procedure. Brandwood Clinic in De Waterkant has the only registered and accredited SMP practitioners, and co-founders James Hannah and Kim Jessop take their business seriously. They have been operating for a number of years, but only opened their clinic in Napier Street last month. Jessop said they studied at Brandwood Clinic in the UK, and still adhere to the same stringent guidelines and standards set by their international partners. Permanent make-up and tattoo artists often claim to be adept at SMP, but Jessop warned that, as there is no regulatory body in South Africa to oversee the procedures and practitioners, clients could be left disappointed, if not permanently scarred, with no recourse. The procedure isn’t cheap, but the results are incredible. Hannah has had his head done. He’s even designed a scar in his hairline so it looks even more natural. The procedure takes between three and four sessions of two to four hours each, and every consideration is taken into account during an in-depth initial consultation. It costs between R7000 and R34000, but an individual, obligation-free consultation is recommended as there is no blanket solution for those suffering from hair loss. Hessop and Hannah are passionate about what they do. It’s a labour of love, and it shines through in their interactions with all who walk through their doors.

Internationally acclaimed local surfers Jordy Smith, Frank Solomon and Mikey February have all jumped on board to support the initiative and are seen in three short, shareable videos showcasing Cape Town’s surf talent, natural beauty and world-class surf conditions. It is no surprise that Smith, Solomon and February were hand picked to be the ambassadors for the Wesgro initiative considering their significant achievements and love for their province. Recognised as South Africa’s top pro surfer and most successful, Smith is currently ranked fourth in the world and against all odds won the World Junior Championship in 2006 and the Qualifying Series in 2007. Solomon, Cape Town’s popular pro surfer, is no stranger to the camera as he stars in the Emmy Award winning documentary Let’s Be Frank. Solomon is additionally involved in eco-friendly initiatives and runs a surf project for underprivileged children. February is the first Cape Town surfer to make it into the World Surf League after joining the tour that consists of the world’s top 34 surfers. While streaming the videos, viewers are to expect features of each of the three local surfers expressing their personal relationship with water and how the recent drought affected everyone in the province. The campaign conveys the message that “Cape Town and the Western Cape is a leading destination for responsible tourism, and adventure tourism, with some of the best surfing conditions on the planet, and is open for business”. The videos display the City’s surf spots giving a taste of its world-class attractions and scenery - and exhibits Cape Town’s breathtaking tourist experience that are “all still here” waiting for tourists. The first video launched in the series can be viewed and shared using the hashtag #ItsAllStillHere.   @iswanderfam  miche.edwards@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

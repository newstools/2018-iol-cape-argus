Today, the Supreme Court of Appeal will hear a case that seeks to ensure that child victims of crime previously not protected by the law, should not have their personal details published. The CCL seeks to ensure that the identities of these children are protected even after the age of 18. In a statement, the organisation said the identification of children might have a catastrophic impact on their lives. “The default position should be that the protection to children currently offered, with victims included, should continue beyond 18. If the media wants to reveal their identities they may apply to a court, and a court can grant permission where it is in the interests of justice and in the public interest to do so,” the statement read. The centre’s Zita Hansungule said even child offenders were vulnerable, and if their identity was not protected they could become victims of stigma and suffer shame and humiliation. On Thursday, the Cape Argus reported the case of Ntuthuzelo Mayekiso, 26, who was convicted for the murder of his 14-month-old daughter. Mayekiso, 13 at the time, was sentenced for the rape and murder of another 13-year-old girl. He was sent to reformatory school. “Instead of identifying child offenders we should be paying attention to what we are doing to strengthen rehabilitation programmes, integration and communities. “There needs to be more support.” Director of the Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence, Valdi van Reenen le Roux, said she supported the legal organisation. “I agree that there should be confidentiality while the offender is a minor, and even after. If they are identified post-18 years old, then they will be stigmatised,” she said. Manenberg Safety Forum chairperson Roegshanda Pascoe was another who agreed with CCL. “Society is good at judging. We must ask why a child committed the crime in the first place,” she said. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

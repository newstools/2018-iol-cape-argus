Cape Town - A quick survey in the streets of Cape Town found widespread support for the legalisation of dagga and agreement with the Constitutional Court judgment to allow its use and cultivation in private homes. Divina Tchibambe, 23, from Athlone said she is excited about the news. “I think they (the Constitutional Court) should do more and make it completely legal instead of making it legal only for private use in your home. I think it does not lead to more crime. “If people are allowed to do it in public without having to sneak around then it would lessen the percentage of crime. I’m a smoker myself so I think it does not have a negative impact on health. It’s a natural ingredient so it helps with cancer and other illnesses.” Herlana Liberty, 28 from Parow said she is a fan of dagga. “I don’t think cannabis leads to more crime, it’s more the other drugs like tik, etc, that can lead to crime. I actually think it makes people more civilised. Deen Byl, 34, from Sanddrift said: “I am fine with it being legalised in the home, as long as dealers are not taking advantage of this and not over-charge people. If I could compare SA to the Netherlands, weed has been distributed legally there since the 1980s and the majority of the people there actually do not smoke weed.” Shaheeda Isaacs, 63, from Surrey Estate said: “I don’t think it’s a good idea. There are a lot of things already going on in the household when it comes to childhood abuse, babies and pregnant women in the home. If people are going to be allowed to smoke it in the house, it is obviously going to go above just that. If it’s legalised the proper way, for medicinal usage, then I won’t have a problem with it. I use the cannabis oil, but there are no side effects compared to smoking it.” @TheCapeArgus  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

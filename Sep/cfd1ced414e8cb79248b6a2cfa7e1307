They completed their construction industry training as part of the Community Skills Training Project. Mayor Patricia de Lille said: “The City of Cape Town is truly grateful to our partners, Acsa and the False Bay TVET College, for their investment and commitment to the residents of Cape Town. "This is testament to the fact that we can all work together to empower our residents, especially those who come from disadvantaged communities. "I am positive the training and skills received by these residents will go a long way in contributing to an improvement in their way of living,” De Lille said. Last year, the City of Cape Town, in association with the Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) and the False Bay Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) College, launched a skills development programme to benefit 100 residents from Blikkiesdorp. They received their certificates from the college as well as tool kits. Students who completed the accredited skills programme received their statements of results from the Construction Seta. The City of Cape Town, through the mayor’s job creation fund, committed a further R300 000, while the City’s Transport and Urban Development Authority’s training academy committed R750 000 towards the project. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

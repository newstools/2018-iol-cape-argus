The indaba was to raise an awareness on the safety of youth and children, particularly in the streets. It was held to give a voice to the children who play in the streets daily, and who are vulnerable to car accidents, child abductions, and generally unable to enjoy the streets as freely as they should. Last year, 50 child pedestrians were killed in Cape Town streets, according to research. “We have to acknowledge that our streets are not safe for children. Congestion, unsafe, broken sidewalks,” said Yolande Baker, executive director for Childsafe South Africa. “The plan of this project is to rethink the nature of the streets and the children. We hope for children to be allowed to play freely, express themselves and to be creative,” said Siviwe Mbinda, founder of the Happy Feet Youth Project and co-founder of Ithuba Innovation Hub. “We’re involving the children, for them to be allowed to give their ideas as well,” said Mbinda. Various child bodies took part in the indaba, including the Gauteng City-Region Observatory and Development Action Group. @Sukainaish  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

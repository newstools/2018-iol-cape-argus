“The significance of this is for us to protect the principles of transparency and public participation,” said Tauriq Jenkins, chairperson of the association. It's been an ongoing battle between residents of Observatory and the City, after claims that the City didn't follow due processes of having public participation for the fencing and leasing of the park and Hartleyvale Stadium grounds for R8500 a month to the Premier Soccer League. The lease agreement, signed earlier this year, is valid for two years and 11 months and will see the grounds' revamp into a R250 million, 10000-seater stadium. The City claimed that residents and civic organisations received a notice about the agreement. However, 106 neighbouring residents and the civic association signed affidavits stating the contrary. In their submission, the Observatory Civic Association asked that the lease be set aside, pending due process and proper consultation. The City spokesperson, Luthando Tyhalibongo, said there was no legal requirement to hold a public participation process in order to enclose the remaining section of the field boundary. “Around 75% of the facility was already enclosed prior to the installation of additional fencing. Fencing is being used as a security measure." @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

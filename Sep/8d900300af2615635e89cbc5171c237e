BKYM is a group that aims to uplift the community in all aspects and strives to protect its culture and customs. Four months ago, the movement held a protest and erected burning barricades in Wale Street to raise awareness about the issue of gentrification in Bo-Kaap. “The feedback from the public was not entirely positive, however, the protests drew attention and the public became more open to the idea once they saw the crowds,” says Aneeqah Solomons, the public relations officer in the group. “Also, the burning of the tyres did raise the necessary concerns that were to be addressed by the City of Cape Town and developers,” she said. “All those people who have been neglected, we want to fight for those people,” said Adnaan Osman, the deputy chairperson of the group said. A meeting was held on Wednesday at the Young Stars Hall, in Bo-Kaap, to discuss a launch of the upcoming event called, “These Streets”. “BKYM is a recently registered non-profit company of the Bo-Kaap. “Our upcoming event is totally different to the tyre burning. These Streets will be a display of our Heritage and values as a community,” says Solomons. The group wants to close off Wale and Rose streets and is seeking permission to do so. “We plan to have a variety of recreational activities, showcasing our sports and cultural heritage. “Coon troops (Klopse) and Malay Choirs will also be present. “There will be other forms of entertainment for those not participating in the sports events and the children will have more than enough to keep them busy,” said Osman. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

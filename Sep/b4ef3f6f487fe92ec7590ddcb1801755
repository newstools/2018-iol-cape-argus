This year the Color Run introduces the all-new Carnival Tour theme that brings bursts of colour: stilt walkers; balloon shapers; new T-shirts and even new running gear. “It doesn’t matter if it’s your first experience with The Color Run or you’ve been joining in for years, the Carnival Tour will be the most memorable 5k of your life,” says The Color Run South Africa team. Color runners will receive a limited edition carnival race shirt, headband, powder pack and temporary tattoos. The Carnival Tour will have the coloured up 5km Color Runners parade and even hop through the streets of Seapoint and Green Point Promenade, when the starter gun goes off at 3pm. The Color Run has committed to leaving Cape Town cleaner than it found it, said the organisers The event will be minimising mess, litter and the need for water-based cleaning through large PVC sheeting, large vacuum cleaners and volunteers on the day. Only non-potable water will be used for cleaning. "We implemented drastic water saving measures for our Cape Town and Stellies events in 2017 with great success and are looking to ensure that this year’s event goes even further. This years event will not add additional strain to the municipality’s already strained water resources,” says the organisation. Furthermore, the organiser will be collecting all the colorful race tees after the event and will distribute them to the needy. “Our mission is to bring people together and make the world a happier, healthier place,” says the Color Run South Africa team.

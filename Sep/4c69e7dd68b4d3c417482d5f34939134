The company said on Monday that the service would be held at 2pm on September 20. The names of those who died were only released on Sunday after DNA tests. It is believed that some of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, making them difficult to identify. “The memorial will honour our dedicated colleagues, Nico Angelo Samuels, Stevon Robert Isaacs, Mxolisi Sigadla, Bradley Tandy, Jamie Lesley Haydricks, Jason Hartzenberg, Triston Lance Davids and Thandolwethu Mankayi,” the company said in a statement. “We will hold a memorial service at the RDM Somerset West site from 2pm to 5pm on Thursday, September 20. The service will include tributes and songs as we remember our colleagues,” said RDM chief executive Norbert Schulze. The memorial event will be open to the public, so the community at large can pay their respects. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

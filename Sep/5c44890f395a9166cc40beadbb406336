The institute has moulded the minds of hundreds of children and is now preparing to celebrate its 40th anniversary on September 8. “I’m honoured and proud of (the school’s) rich history based on the building blocks set by our esteemed predecessors in 1978. We are immensely pleased that through our efforts we are able to do justice to the expectation of our motto ‘success through education’,” said school principal Mumtaz Bapoo. “Our success is incomplete (without) parents, learners and educators.” Nelson Mandela visited the school in 2001 to acknowledge the work they had done in uplifting the community. “May we grow from strength to strength,” said Bapoo. The 40th anniversary celebration takes place on Saturday at the Masjid Hall at 4.30pm.

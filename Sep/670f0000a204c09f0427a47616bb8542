On Tuesday, Phillips made a brief appearance at the Western Cape High Court before the case was postponed to Tuesday, September 11. Judge Lee Bozalek was due to deliver his judgment in the drawn-out trial. However, he said he was not ready. “Due to other duties I have, I have been unable to complete judgment,” he said. Phillips is faced with charges of rape and murder. On New Year’s Eve in 2013, he and the deceased attended a rave party in Paarl. The State alleged that, around midnight, Phillips, Chauhan and some friends took drugs and went dancing. A short while later, Chauhan started feeling sick. She and the accused went to a tent they had been sharing, for Chauhan to rest. About an hour later, the accused called for help because Chauhan had experienced seizures. It was initially believed Chauhan had died of a drug overdose. However, a State autopsy report said she had been strangled. This report is disputed by the defence’s forensic pathologist, Dr Steve Naidoo, who said in his report the cause of death was linked to a drug overdose. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

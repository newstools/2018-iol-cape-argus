The self-built shack theatre, which has been operating for eight years under the theme “Theatre4Change”, mainly focuses on educational opportunities for young people in Khayelitsha. The theatre also pilots numerous local and international arts festivals such as Abongile Kroza One-Handers Festival and the Vuka Mandela Theatrical Magic festival every July 18, in collaboration with Makukhanye Art Room. From Friday, the Shack Theatre has be showcasing The Great African Caravan Theatre Show by the Art Caravan Association, with 12 international artists from India, Argentina, Britain, Uganda, Germany and Kosovo. On September 22, the Shack Theatre will host AfroFest organised by the City of Cape Town. Mandisi Sindo, the founder of Shack Theatre and Makukhanye Art Room, said the theatre has become an increasingly important gathering space for dramatic productions, dance recitals, educational workshops, mentorship programmes and community meetings. “Theatre lovers are currently rehearsing and performing in this small, self-built shack theatre. Our aim is to provide a platform for growth and development for young people within the township.” Sindo works with a diverse range of community participants and artists in creating an artistic platform for young people. The Theatre4Change team includes Mbulelo Grootboom, Zanele Siko Radu, Khayalethu Anthony and Asanda Rolityana. Theatre4Change has recently started the construction of the Khayelitsha Art School Institute and Rehabilitation Centre, which will also serve as another Shack Art Centre, in walking distance from Monwabisi Beach. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

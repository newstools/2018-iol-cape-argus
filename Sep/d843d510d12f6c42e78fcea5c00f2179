Braydon was hit by a stray bullet during a gang shootout while in the arms of his mother Rostan Graaff on October 22, 2016. The bullet first hit his mother’s hand before entering his chest. Renaldo Galant, Charlton Renier and Andrew Hendricks faced charges of murder, two of attempted murder, assault to cause grievous bodily harm, as well as a charge for the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Western Cape High Court judge Thandazwa Ndita on Thursday acquitted Hendricks of all charges. The court heard that after Galant had tucked a firearm in his pants when they got out of the car, he gave it to Renier, who fired the shots. “The evidence doesn't establish with certainty that accused three (Hendricks) saw the exchange of the firearm by accused one and two (Galant and Renier),” said Judge Ndita. It was unclear whether Hendricks had aligned himself with what was about to follow. “Accused one and two had a rapport. They shared a common purpose, despite all three men denying being members of the G. Unit,” she said. The case has been postponed to October 16. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

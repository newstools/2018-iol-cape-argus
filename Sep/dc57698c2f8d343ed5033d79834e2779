This initiative, “Hype Your Heritage”, is a first for South African radio and has been airing on the Breakfast Show with presenter and concept creator Dan Corder since Monday. Corder said: “From the beginning of September until Heritage Day, September 24, we aim to create many articles that meaningfully add to the presence of South Africa’s heritage on the internet so our heritage will exist for future generations to learn about.” He said the station will also emphasise how all South Africans can contribute by recording their heritage for everyone to know about. The show has partnered with South African History Online and WikiMedia South Africa to document more of South Africa’s history online. Good Hope FM’s station manager Brendan Ficks said the station is Cape Town’s original radio station. “We are an integral part of Cape Town’s heritage, which is why we wanted to take the lead when it comes to making sure we preserve our legacy that is at risk of being lost or forgotten.”      The station has asked listeners to identify places, people, historical moments and cultural happenings that matter to their communities. The team will identify stories that have not yet been thoroughly and accessibly saved on the internet. South African History Online historians will collaborate with Wikipedia South Africa editors to create well researched records of these pieces of heritage, on Wikipedia and the online website. Tune in to Good Hope FM every day for updates about “Hype Your Heritage” and to find out how you can contribute. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

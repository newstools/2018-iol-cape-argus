Madikizela was responding to critics who claim he is losing his grip on the party, especially in respect of mayors. DA insiders said a liberal grouping was vigorously pushing for Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde to take over the reins from Premier Helen Zille. “If someone like Alan is in the running, what makes him better than me? “This subtle racism must come to an end. What are the criteria to be a premier? The DA has criteria, and those claiming that the criteria are this or that, they are just wrong,” Madikizela said. Sources said he was unfit following the controversies in municipalities such as Cape Town, Knysna and George. “If there are massive problems in municipalities; can that be blamed on me? If there are councillors who are ill-disciplined, how can I be blamed?” Madikizela, who is Human Settlements MEC, and Winde are in the running for the premiership post. Finance MEC I van Meyer is also a likely candidate. Other possibles include Social Development MEC Albert Fritz and Local Government MEC Anton Bredell. Madikizela said the battle wasn’t between him and Winde. “I’m in a portfolio for the last 10 years that has enabled me to interact with many communities. “With my experience and political background I’m in a good position. If I wasn’t confident, I wouldn’t have applied to succeed the premier.” Winde said his track record of being innovative and open put him in good stead. “I think the enabling environment that attracted investment and created jobs is my biggest achievement, along with great teams in government. “Cutting red tape and increasing business confidence levels show the work that had been done. “We have outperformed the country by a long way.” The candidates for premier will be announced on September 9. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

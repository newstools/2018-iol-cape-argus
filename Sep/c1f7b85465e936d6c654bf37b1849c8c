Hundreds of residents attended a service in their traditional wear. The service was attended by Deputy Minister of Human Settlements Zou Kota-Fredericks, councillor Luvuyo Zondani of ward 38, councillor Sonwabo Ngxumza of ward 42, community dancers and development leaders from Gugulethu. Fredericks said the event was to encourage an active citizenry and celebrate South Africa’s diverse cultures. “People of Gugulethu came together under the theme ‘The Year of Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu and Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela: advancing transformation of South Africa’s heritage landscape’.” Fredericks said Gugulethu was one of the communities that housed black people who were forcefully removed from other areas in the province, areas such as Kensington, Athlone and Simon’s Town, and they named the community Gugulethu, from “igugu lethu” or “our pride” in English. “Together we can transform Gugulethu into a better community than it is now,” said Fredericks. Vincent Domingo of the Gugulethu Development Forum saw the GDF as a community umbrella body of organisations that co-ordinates and facilitates the attainment of shared skills, resources, growth and development through education and training interventions. Ngxumza said: “We will also honour the companions of Mandela and the former activist from Gugulethu who played a pivotal role during the release of the struggle stalwart.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

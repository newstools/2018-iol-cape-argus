A party was held for her at Grassy Park Hall in Grassy Park. This joyous gathering was attended by family members and friends from the community. There were lots of talking and catching up taking place as Oemie brought them all together at this heart-warming occasion. The grand dame expressed her gratitude, and with a soft smile said: “It is through my daughter Washiela that I could have this day. This made me happy,” her daughter, Washiela Staggie, 64, said her mother had lived with her all these years and had taught her a lot. “Oemie always taught me certain things, because one day she will not be here and I will have to take over the family.” After decades of easy and difficult experiences, Oemie is enriched with wisdom about life. Asked how she felt about the youth of today, Oemie said, “Baie seer (Sad). They need to have Taqwa (being conscious of God) and Imaan (faith).” Her nephew Hasiem Gaidien, fondly recollected memories he shared with her. “Oemie is a woman of great character, who has endured a lot. I have known her since childhood and she is truly one with ‘sabr’ (patience),” an emotional Gaidien said. Oemie was able to live for so many years because she liked to work and walked a lot, he daughter said. Whenever I would look for Oemie, she would be outside doing the washing.” Sunday’s atmosphere was one of celebration and joy and it was obvious that Oemie was an inspiration to all of them. @TheCapeArgus  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The cycling event, the largest on the cycling calendar grows each year in stature. It is competitive, but also encourages a healthy lifestyle. Next year’s tour takes place on March 10. The entry process for the epic tour will occur in a systematic process to prevent the entries from reaching the limit at a fast pace and to hinder the overflow of entries in the system as experienced in previous years. “Entries for the Cape Town Cycle Tour are capped at 35 000, which is the limit for safety and logistical reasons,” said David Bellairs, director of the Cape Town Cycle Tour Trust. The general entry fee for South African residents is R540 and the international fee is R1000. To enter go to www.capetowncycletour.com The general entries close on October 20 at 4pm or until the limit has been reached and the international entries close in January next year. Paid-up members of the Pedal Power Association (PPA) were able to enter between August 27 and September 3. Charity group applications opened on August 27 and will continue until further notice. It has been done this way to acknowledge the loyal supporters of the event, explains Bellairs. Cape Town cyclists who would like to take part in the Cape Town Cycling Tour this year can start preparing themselves for the upcoming cycling tour.

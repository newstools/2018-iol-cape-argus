The Hout Bay Dune Rehabilitation Project is managed by the City's Coastal Management Branch. It covers approximately 70000m² of the reformed, netted and planted dune. The project has considerably reduced the build-up of sand on city infrastructure and private properties. The reformed dune comprises three areas - the fore-dune, buffer-dune and back-dune. The appropriate dune vegetation has been planted, as stated by the requirements of each dune area. Herron visited the Rehabilitation Project, to plant the Milkwood tree. The tree will contribute to the species and diversity of vegetation, and has already been planted on the back-dune. “The Hout Bay Dune Rehabilitation Project is a very interesting initiative that helps us to look at how the migration and movement of dunes can be managed. This project has been making progress to help improve the lives of residents and to ensure accessibility to the city's infrastructure. It has also created employment opportunities for 10 workers." The City is currently compiling a Hout Bay Dune Maintenance Tender, which will seek to appoint a contractor to maintain the Hout Bay Dune Rehabilitation Project for the next three years - until 2021. During the first three year maintenance period, the City's Coastal Management Branch will plan and assess the requirements of the maintenance process. It is expected that the good work will continue on the site and potentially increase local employment opportunities. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

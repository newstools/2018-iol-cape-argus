Mahilihili faced charges of trespassing, public violence and causing malicious damage to property. The case was postponed until September 26. The former mechanical engineering student was arrested at the CPUT Athlone campus on Saturday. According to #FeesMustFall activists, who declined to be named, the charges were dropped in 2015. “Sapho got arrested for something he knows nothing about,” said one activist. Mahilihili was among the students suspended following the protests. According to the activists, the suspension was lifted. However, when he returned, he could not be traced on the university's system. “The issue is that CPUT has an issue with students leading at the forefront of wanting to liberate masses within the university. CPUT is graduating students with criminal records (and) having them arrested for no reason. This is just another case of victimisation,” said the #FeesMustFall activist. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said Mahilihili was not a CPUT student, but was well-known to the institution. She said the case was now a police matter, which the university would continue to monitor. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

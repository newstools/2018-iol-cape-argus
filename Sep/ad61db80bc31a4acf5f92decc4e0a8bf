“The event is in recognition of work put into preserving the unique flora and fauna along its coastline while providing opportunities for environmental education, sustainable tourism and the empowerment of local communities,” said national coastal co-ordinator Robert Slater. The Green Coast Status Award flag was also handed to the nature reserve. Green Coast is Wessa’s newest eco-label, awarded to coastal sites in South Africa where a sensitive species, habitat or cultural heritage site is being sustainably managed, leading to increased tourism along the coastline. The Blaauwberg Nature Reserve has shown ongoing commitment to conserving and monitoring its sensitive coastal areas. “The Blaauwberg Nature Reserve has now set the bar for Wessa Green Coast sites to come. The Wessa Green Coast site will bring tourists who have an interest in conservation and sustainable tourism,” said Slater. WESSA will review the status annually. The Blaauwberg Hill at the nature reserve is one of the few viewpoints in the world from where you can see two proclaimed World Heritage Sites, namely, Table Mountain and Robben Island. Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said communities played a vital role in protecting our biodiversity. “As the most biodiverse city in the world, we have a responsibility to conserve and protect this unique biodiversity, but we cannot do it alone,” he said. “Valuable partnerships with local communities and organisations enable us to sustainably manage our precious fauna and flora. "The City cannot uphold the Green Coast Status on our own. We need the support of our communities and organisations to ensure the success of the Green Coast Programme. We think particularly of our next generation of nature enthusiasts." @thelionmutters  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

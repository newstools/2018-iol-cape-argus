Mayor Patricia de Lille said the ongoing gang violence had claimed hundreds of lives in areas such as Hanover Park, Manenberg, Kewtown and all over the Cape Flats. Mary Claasen, who lost her son, Devan Claasen, 5, in Hanover Park and is a member of the movement Moms Move for Justice, said her son was shot 13 times two doors away from his home. “I know the pain of a mom who lost her child. “That pain has opened my eyes to join Moms Move for Justice to bring hope and comfort to other women,” she said. De Lille offered her support and sympathies to the community of Hanover Park, singling out the family of Keagan de Silver 17, a peace ambassador and Grade 11 pupil from Mount View High School who was gunned down near his Hanover Park home on August 22.

Keagan’s burial service will proceed today, from Calvary Baptist Mission Church to Mount View High School. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

There were approximately 125 825 properties with a municipal valuation of R200 000 or less, which are considered as indigent,” Blake said. Speaking on the non-payments and defaulters, Blake said final demand letters would be sent out on a monthly basis to those debtors whose accounts fell into arrears. “During June 2018, 20853 letters of demand were sent out and 1180 debtors were listed for adverse credit listing.

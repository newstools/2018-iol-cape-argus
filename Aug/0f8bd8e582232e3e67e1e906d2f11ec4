The final 32 teams have been revealed as the knockouts for the quiz will continue into its second week. Earlier this week, a Maitland High School pupil said participating in the quiz was a challenge, but pupils were hungry for a repeat victory, given that they were reigning champions. “It’s so stressful because before in the round robin stage you know that you can bounce back, but now when you’re out, then you’re out,” explained Team B member, Ruvimbo Mhari. “We’ve been studying every day and every interval. It feels like an 8th subject,” said matric learner Prince Motomb. Mr Riedwaan Kenny, principal of the high school said that he is proud of the learners from the three teams that have made into the next knockout. “The Cape Argus comes out in English and for most of our learners, it’s not their home language. As a result, they have taken up this challenge, but it’s more the application of the learners and the skills that they have developed that has made us as a school be successful. “They are enthusiastic. As a principal I’m extremely proud as it the learners are showing off our tenacity.” For the 10th birthday of the competition, the winning school will receive R35000 and the winning team will receive R3000 per team member. Up for grabs are also two bursaries offered by the Community Chest. Good Hope FM has also come aboard as this year’s radio partner for the competition, with the station’s Nigel Pierce being the quizmaster for the finals. The Cape Argus has launched a “Cape Argus Food Lover’s Market High Schools Quiz” page for updates on all the latest quiz news. It will be the first time the top two teams of the Cape Argus Food Lover’s Market High Schools Quiz will compete in the National High School Quiz in Sandton in September. @TheCapeArgus  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

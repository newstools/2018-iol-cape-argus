Otterbeck and six other people, who sustained injuries, were walking home in Table View at night on December 14, 2016 when Futter allegedly knocked them over. Futter, who is out on bail, faces charges of culpable homicide, driving under the influence of alcohol, reckless or negligent driving and assault. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. On Wednesday the Cape Town Regional Court heard the testimony of Elton Luyt, a police detective who was working as a doorman at the Doodles pub where Futter and a friend had been drinking. He testified that Futter was heavily intoxicated. Luyt was moonlighting as a doorman while still in the police service. “He (Futter) had slurred speech, redness in his eyes and was unstable on his feet,” he said. Luyt said he had an altercation with Futter over the pub’s rule prohibiting people from leaving with opened liquor. Futter was leaving the pub with a glass of beer in his hand. “He became very aggressive with me, I took the glass from his hand, and then he threw a swing at me with a closed fist. “I blocked it. His friend intervened and stopped him,” said the detective. Luyt said the last time he saw Futter was when he sped off in his silver Polo. Then he was informed by another patron that Futter had “killed somebody”. “The wheels were spinning when he took off with high speed,” said Luyt. Futter’s lawyer, Keith Gess, said his client disputed Luyt’s testimony. “The accused said you punched him and he fell on the floor and he almost went unconscious. His friend assisted him and explained what had happened. “If he was so heavily intoxicated, you would’ve stopped him from driving off and endangering others,” said Gess. The trial continues today. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

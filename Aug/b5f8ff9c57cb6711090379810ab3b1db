“Mama Dora” - as she has been fondly named by the lovely Erica Place staff - is quite the local celebrity at the Athlone facility. After moving into Erica Place around six years ago, Mama Dora has become known for her quick-witted humour and resilience against all the ailments which typically accompany old age. “She has never been ill all her life and the only time she has needed a hospital is when she was giving birth to her children,” said daughter Joy, the eldest of Mama Dora’s four children. Born and raised in Stellenbosch, Mama Dora quickly developed a passion for music and physical education, competing as a provincial level tennis player throughout her youth. Her generous nature inspired her to help others within the community, resulting in her entire working life being spent in education and teaching. Stellenbosch, Oudtshoorn and Cape Town schools all benefited from her enthusiasm, so much so that after retiring, she was called back to work in a Cape Town primary school, aged 75. Joy, now moving into her seventies herself, praised the impact her mother has had on family life: “Growing up, she was a strict disciplinarian. She always made sure that all of her children stayed in school until they had received a proper education. These values have really stuck in our family, and all of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren have followed her example so far.” When asked what the secret to Mama Dora’s enduring health is, Joy attributed her strong reserve to her eating habits growing up: “Her father had a healthy vegetable garden while she was growing up. They were one of these families that live from ground to pot - always very healthy food.” Joy recognises her mother will not be around forever, but there’s a strong sense Mama Dora’s legacy will be treasured by her family for many years to come. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

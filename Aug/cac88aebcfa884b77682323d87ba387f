The review which was published in the journal PLOS Medicine, which will inform the World Health Organisation guidelines on treating MDR-TB, showed that 78% of children had a successful outcome when treated with MDR-TB drugs. “To date, little has been known about the optimal treatment for these children with (MDR-TB). “This review gives vitally important information as to potential outcomes and some very good news for the TB field.” “An estimated 32000 children develop MDR-TB, which is resistant to the two main TB drugs, each year,” said Professor Anneke Hesseling from the Desmond Tutu TB Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at Stellenbosch University “Treatment for MDR-TB is of a longer duration and requires drugs that are more toxic. These regimens are hard to tolerate, particularly in children,” added Professor Hesseling. Hesseling said due to the length of treatment and drug toxicity, a review of the drugs’ effectiveness was done to study the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 975 children from 18 countries. The results showed that 78% of these children had successful treatment outcomes when treated with second-line MDR-TB drugs. However, the treatment was less effective in children with HIV and TB and were not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). “Treatment was successful in only 56% of children with TB who were infected with HIV. This highlights the urgent need for ART in these children, which should be a priority in our setting, where rates of HIV and TB co-infection are so high,” said Hesseling. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

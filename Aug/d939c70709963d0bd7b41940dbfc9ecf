With an ambitious target of R10 million, the university has set aside 100 days to raise money for the instalment of sustainable food banks at the Stellenbosch and Tygerberg campuses. The movement starts today on the Rooiplein on the Stellenbosch Campus with a mini-concert at 12pm and a fund-raising concert in the Endler Hall in Victoria Street at 1pm. Entrance fee is anything between R10 and R100, or a non-perishable food item. Despite perceptions that Stellenbosch University students are not greatly affected by such issues, around 6 in every 100 new students (first years and first-year postgraduate students) are at risk of going hungry while studying. This translates into 465 newcomers of the recent intake, which is increased when students in other years are considered. The campaign culminates on November 27, and organisers have scheduled a wide range of fund-raising activities to make sure the target is met. One event, which has already captured the imagination of Stellenbosch’s “Maties” is the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon, scheduled for September 23. Over 60 runners have already signed up and around 20 fund-raising pages are now live. The movement has even spread to the university’s staff. Olympic Games silver medallist and SU alumni Elana Meyer challenged Maties rector and vice-chancellor Wim de Villiers to take part in the race, and he accepted. “One student that goes hungry on our campus is one too many,” said De Villiers. “I challenge staff, students, donors, alumni and friends of the university, as well as the general public, to do the same. “Let’s team up to help our students finish their race.” As well as addressing hunger concerns, #Move4Food is encouraging students to raise money for the campaign by taking up active challenges, such as cycling to work and arranging an “old-school sports day”.

In a statement, the MJC said it was immensely saddened. MJC president Shaykh Irafaan Abrahams said Hendricks was known as a visionary with outstanding leadership abilities, oratory skills and a passion and willingness to serve the community. “May Allah Almighty grant our illustrious Moulana Ihsaan Hendricks the highest stage of Jannah Ameen. “May Allah Almighty grant the community of Cape Town and South Africa leaders who will follow in his footsteps and continue his vision of serving humanity for the sake of Allah Almighty Ameen,” Abrahams said. Premier Helen Zille extended her heartfelt condolences “to the family, loved ones and entire the Muslim community, on the passing of Moulana Ihsaan Hendricks”. “I met Mr Hendricks while he was still president of the Muslim Judicial Council. He was a fierce defender of human rights and wanted to see people’s lives across the Western Cape improved. His death is a tremendous loss, for both the Muslim community and the province. May his soul rest in peace,” said Zille. ANC MPL Cameron Dugmore and ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs also attended Hendricks’s funeral on Saturday. Hendricks, who was born in Worcester, was the president of the MJC for 10 years. He was also the director of the Al-Quds Foundation SA, executive member of the International Union of Muslim Scholars and a member of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth. Abrahams said Hendricks’s Christian grandmother and mother were well versed in traditional Christian theology, where honesty and integrity were important. @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus

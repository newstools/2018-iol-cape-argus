This is according to Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde, who was addressing a media briefing on the inaugural Africa Halaal Week in Cape Town on Tuesday. The event, hosted by the province, the City and Wesgro, is set to take place in October 15 and 17 at the Westin Hotel. Winde said the halaal market was worth a trillion dollars a year, which had shown growth potential of 6% and a product value of about $750billion (R9.9 trillion). Winde said that by hosting the conference in the Western Cape, the province had the potential to create a platform which could boost the province’s export market. He said that looking at the growth potential of the halaal market presented huge opportunities for the region. “I think the platform (halaal conference) that has been created is very exciting for me. I’m certain it is something that local businesses are also excited about. I see this specific sector making an impact on our job numbers,” he said. Wesgro chief executive Tim Harris said Cape Town came across as a tolerant and diverse city with a deep history of culture. He said the city needed to take the culture, the fashion, the food, the tapestry of different communities and move it to where the city was going in the future. “The differentiator for me is that sense of tolerance, that huge diversity and how we all get along with that, which is not the case in many cities around the world. “Cape Town comes across as an extremely tolerant and rich in history place, and that’s why we can take that to the centre and say, let’s not just talk about the food but all the other elements that weave together to present a rich diversity and tolerance to the rest of the world,” said Harris.  joseph.booysen@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The cleaning activities were in wards 33, 34, 43, 80 and 88, and are set to continue in other wards within the Philippi precinct after hundreds of bags of rubbish were collected. The ANC appealed to the City to get trucks and bags to clean up the rubbish that had been piling up in the community. Gugubele explained the importance of this Thuma Mina(send me) campaign in keeping our communities clean, before a community meeting. “We are trying to instil the culture of self-help in terms of keeping good health standards. We must take responsibility as citizens and we must be a society that does not tolerate uncleanliness,” said Gugubele. ANC Youth League secretary in ward 34 Thabisa Njwele said some of the roads had been cleaned during the first Thuma Mina campaign and on Mandela day, but to their dismay, they had filled up with rubbish again. “We are pleading with the public to take care of their communities and avoid illegal dumping sites,” said Njwele. Fanikhaya Ntsinde, who participated in the first clean-up, said the campaign was good because it taught people about cleanliness and hygiene, reminding them not to dump rubbish and litter. After the campaign, the Philippi community gathered to discuss solutions for service delivery, and how to keep their community clean. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

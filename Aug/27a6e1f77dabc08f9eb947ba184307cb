The purpose of the policy will be to address how the City partners, interacts and communicates with various sporting bodies regarding the maintenance of municipal sporting facilities. “Our City-owned sports facilities are some the most used spaces in the city, and provide a location for weekend recreation, mid-week practice sessions, and serve as safe venues during school holidays. The draft policy also addresses the optimal use and self-sufficiency of facilities, environmental sustainability, equitable sport and recreation services, and the requirements for clubs to have sport-development programmes,” said mayco member for safety and security; and social Services JP Smith. The policy covers all outdoor and indoor municipal sports grounds and facilities where sport is played, including municipal sports facilities run with educational institutions, private sector organisations and NGOs. It excludes resorts, public toilets, swimming pools and community halls. “We recognise the benefits and importance of involving communities and regular patrons in the management, maintenance and security of facilities. It promotes a sense of ownership, pride and communal responsibility. However, clear guidance is needed on the powers, rights, roles and responsibilities of sports clubs and regular patrons operating on City-owned land or using City-owned sport facilities,” said Smith. Chief executive of the Western Province Cricket Association (WPCA), Nabeal Dien, said: “We believe that this can solve many problems such as safety at various sporting facilities in different communities. Remember; there’s only so much we can do as an organisation.” The WPCA has been calling for the City to improve safety at a number of sporting facilities, particularly those in disadvantaged areas. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

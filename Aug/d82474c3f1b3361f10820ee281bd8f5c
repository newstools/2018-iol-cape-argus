“Crime and drugs in our area are a growing problem and they lead to many business owners losing their lives,” said Jameelah Moodley, chairperson of the Parow Business and Community Forum. The most highly publicised was the kidnapping of 65-year-old businessman Liaqat Parker. It is believed Parker was driving into the basement of his business premises in Parow when an unknown double cab LDV followed him. At the gate, the suspects forced the security guard into the toilet at gunpoint, before taking his cellphone and locking him in. They proceeded to the basement where they forced the businessman into their vehicle and drove off in an unknown direction. Moodley said: “We have given them two weeks to respond to the memorandum.” Among the demands listed in their memorandum was a call for a satellite police station at Parow taxi rank on the Northlink side to be opened. They also requested a meeting with the ward councillor, Franchesca Walker, to request CCTV cameras in the area. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Staff, who face dismissal, are saddled with managing the transfer of approximately 40 patients battling chronic illnesses to new facilities at St Joseph’s Home for Chronically Ill Children. However, Sarah Fox social worker Ashleigh Benjamin said staff were uncertain about how to manage the process in such a short time. “There are about 40 patients. There are around 20 children we could possibly move over if we want to get them over in the next month, which is difficult. “There is no physical plan on how we’re going to move the children. I feel so sad about it; we’re given a month’s notice. Couldn’t they have given us enough time or done this themselves? “Why should myself and the (occupational therapist) be saddled with ideas on how to do this? Why should we draw up notices to parents?” said Benjamin. Benjamin said nobody was taking the patients’ families into consideration. There was also the emotional well-being of patients to consider. National Union of Public Service Allied Workers (Nupsaw) provincial manager Omar Parker said according to their own investigation St Joseph’s did not have the capacity to absorb all the patients. “Our shop steward did an investigation at St Joseph’s, which can only handle half of the capacity with approximately 63 beds. This according to the last information I received. “There is still a lot of anxiety and concern by workers and health professionals about the situation; it’s quite a sensitive situation. People are anxious about the future of the place. Parents are very upset about it,” said Parker. The department was unable to comment on the issue before going to print and St Joseph’s representatives refused to comment on the matter, but said they were prepared to take over the transfer of patients. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

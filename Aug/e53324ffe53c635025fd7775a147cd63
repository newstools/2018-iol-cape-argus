The summit, led by Heavenly Culture World Peace Restoration of Light (HWPL) chairperson Man Hee Lee - who travelled the world to spread the message of attainable peace - singled out ambassadors in Africa championing the cause. Peace ambassadors acknowledged included Cape Argus editor Aziz Hartley, Peace Journalism Foundation founder Gloria Laker from Uganda, and The Voice reporter Daniel Chida from Botswana for their work in promoting peace through media. “Publicity ambassadors are appointed voluntarily and develop and spread a culture of peace. They publicise and encourage citizens to participate in HWPL’s peace projects to increase the awareness and need for peace,” said International Peace Youth Group media liaison Noluvuyo Bacela. Hartley dedicated the award to his newsroom colleagues, who have contributed to promoting peace through journalism. Chida said the award was acknowledgement of the work he was doing in striving to write news pieces that did not cause conflict among races, communities or countries.

Laker said: “I covered war in northern Uganda using a peace journalism style and I use my experience to train young journalists in northern Uganda and east Africa which is engulfed in conflict. There are over 1250000 refugees from Congo who come to Uganda, I report on this a lot using peace journalism. We strive for peace,” said Laker. The award recipients were encouraged to advance the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW) framework, which is a legal document to attain world peace. It hopes to leave a legacy of peace for future generations. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

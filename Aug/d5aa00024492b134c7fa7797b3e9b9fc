On Thursday, councillor Velile Waxa appeared with Avela Dumile and Mandla Makhala at the Knysna magistrate’s court on a charge of murder. Dumile was granted a postponement to allow him time to appoint a private lawyer. He was given until August 30. Meanwhile, the State indicated that it would be opposing bail for all three men on September 12 and 18, when formal bail applications would be heard. Prosecutor Moyisi Makhalela said the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) were looking at adding a fourth accused to the case: Mandla Tyololo. Tyololo, who was initially arrested before the trio, appeared on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Makhalela said the NPA was going to link the two cases so that Tyololo became the fourth accused. Molosi, popularly known as “Freeze”, worked for the municipality and headed mobilisation and training. He was murdered last month while on his way home from a school governing body meeting at Concordia High. The 50-year-old was shot in the head and died soon afterwards in hospital. Both Waxa and Tyololo, who is the secretary of the Knysna Taxi Forum, have influential roles in the community. It is reported that in May Waxa appeared before the council’s disciplinary committee where he was accused of breaching the code of conduct for councillors and interfering with procurement processes. He was also accused of interfering in the management or administration of the integrated human settlements department, without being mandated by the council. The disciplinary committee found Waxa guilty and have requested his removal from the council. The Department of Local Government is assessing the case and will make its recommendation to Local Government MEC Anton Bredell. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

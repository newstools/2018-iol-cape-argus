De Lille’s fifth mayoral pop-up office started at the Albow Gardens council block of flats, where she had a walkabout. She was joined by mayoral committee members Suzette Little and Stuart Diamond, and ward councillor Fabian Ah-Sing. Although many residents came out to see De Lille, few issues were raised as most were interested in taking selfies with her. She said the Albow Gardens flats, where about 1200 people live, were being upgraded. “The project started in October 2017, with three blocks at the south end of the complex being upgraded and completed in the 2017/2018 financial year. Upgrades included repairs to staircases, cracked walls, leaking roofs, eaves gutters, downpipes and windows, and the painting of façades - now completed. The total cost was R2.1million,” De Lille said. She added that the upgrade project formed part of the plan to improve the condition of the City’s rental stock units. “The council rental units are a vital part of the affordable residential accommodation continuum that provides homes to the poorest of the poor residents,” said Diamond. Further upgrades would focus on water-saving initiatives, and would start next month. De Lille then visited a food garden. “I was really impressed with the community food garden that was started to encourage a healthy lifestyle among residents. “The garden was established by the City through the previous ward councillor. It is being kept running by the residents,” she said. After the garden visit, De Lille went to the Albow Gardens clinic and library. At the clinic, senior nurse Glynnis Schreuder told De Lille of the challenges they faced. Schreuder also took her to the clinic’s facilities, where De Lille met several patients. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

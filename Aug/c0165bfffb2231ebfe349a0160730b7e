According to research published in the South African Medical Journal the Western Cape had the highest 12-month and lifetime prevalence of mental illness. “Stress can contribute to mental illness, and can also be a symptom of a mental illness. It is important to recognise though, that not all stress is bad; stress can sometimes motivate people to perform. “However, prolonged periods of unmanaged stress can have many health implications,” said the head of psychological services at Akeso Clinics, Sandy Lewis. “Constant sources of stress (for example, if your work environment is a stressor) can impact mental health negatively. Any stress left unmanaged has the potential to impact an individual’s functioning at work, at home, and on an emotional level.” Marietha de Wet, an industrial psychologist at the Stellenbosch University said: “Work-related or intrinsic stress to the job can affect people such as police members, paramedics and doctors. Also, physical working conditions - facing potential dangerous and volatile situations while having to be outwardly calm and appear fully in control of a situation. Severe ‘danger’ events are likely to precede the onset of an anxiety disorder, and a threatening event that is not part of a person’s lifestyle can result in post-traumatic stress disorder.” De Wet has conducted extensive research on mental illness. She previously worked for 10-years for the police in the Northern Cape as a psychologist and experienced at first hand the intrinsic stress of the job, she said “It is important to create safe working conditions and avenues where employees can get help, like wellness programmes.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

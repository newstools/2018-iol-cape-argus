Over three days, the department will be hosting 100 girls and boys. Each child will be taught the basic techniques of coding. The aim is to encourage previously disadvantaged learners to venture into technology. Pupils from Ikamvalethu Secondary School and Langa High School participated last week. Mondale Secondary School in Mitchells Plain and Dr Nelson Mandela Secondary School in CrossRoads/Philippi participated on Monday, and Bulumko Secondary School in Khayelitsha and Perseverance Secondary School in Belhar on Tuesday. Co-founder of Women in Engineering Naadiya Moosajee said: “Engineers are everywhere: everything around us has been engineered in some way - the cars we ride in, the cellphones we send messages with, the chairs we sit in, even the make-up we wear and the food we eat - there’s maths and science in everyday life.” With a lot of emphasis being placed on introducing more women into the technology industry, the head of UWC’s Department of Information Systems, Dr Mmaki Jantjies, said: “Various studies have reflected that early exposure to IT opportunities and related skills can encourage younger women.” Founder of Kato Technologies and Women In Technology CPT Robyn Farah and founder of GirlHype Thoko Miya were both there providing insightful knowledge. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

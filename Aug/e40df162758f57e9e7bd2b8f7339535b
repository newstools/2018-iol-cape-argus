The trial of Aviwe Hoya, 26, proceeded at the Western Cape High Court after a failed plea and sentencing agreement he was due to follow through with. The man is accused of preying on young girls making their way to school in Khayelitsha. He allegedly kidnapped, robbed and raped them. His victims were aged from 10 to 16. Hoya was arrested two years ago in Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape, after police obtained a warrant for his arrest at the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court. Warrant officer Rowan Andrews said Hoya matched the description given by some of the victims. “The complainants said the accused had a tattoo with the 28s sign on his right hand near his thumb. That helped us make a positive identification,” he told the court. Forensic evidence linked Hoya to the rapes, the court heard. In the State’s summary of facts it is alleged that on September 27, 2011, Hoya threatened a 13-year-old girl at knifepoint near Esangweni Senior Secondary School in Harare, Khayelitsha. She was on her way to school when he allegedly demanded her earrings and forced her to walk to a field where he raped her. The following year, on May 4, he targeted his second victim, another 13-year-old girl in the same area. He allegedly robbed her of her cellphone and took her to a nearby toilet where he forced her to undress before raping her. His third victim, a 16-year-old, was allegedly targeted 17 days later. She was also on her way to the school when Hoya allegedly robbed and raped her in a toilet behind the school. The State alleged Hoya did the same with his two other victims. Trial continues today. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

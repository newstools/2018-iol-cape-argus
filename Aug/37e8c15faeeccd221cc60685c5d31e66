A joint operation was conducted by the Hawks’ National Bureau for Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violent Crime, the Forensic Science Laboratory Ballistic Unit, local criminal record centres and K9 unit. The search was carried out on three business premises from August 21 to 23 in Meyerton, Henley on Klip and Joburg. This led in the seizure of 115 revolvers, five pistols, 60 shotguns and four rifles. Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said the seizure followed an intensive investigation, that started in Cape Town and progressed to Gauteng, into the alleged lack of proper control of firearm stocks by the legal owners. “The confiscated firearms will be subjected to further forensic analysis in order to establish their origins and whether th ey were used in any criminal offences,” said Nkwalase. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation appealed to the Paarl community to contact the unit with information that could lead to the recovery of two stolen hunting rifles and the arrest of housebreaking suspects. Nkwalase said it was alleged that between August 8 and 9, an unknown number of suspects forcefully gained entry to a residence at Samela Game Lodge, Paardeberg Road, Paarl, and stole a .308 Musgrave and a Remington hunting rifle, together with several house implements and clothes. A reward will be given for information that will lead to the recovery of firearms and successful arrest and prosecution of the suspect. Anyone with information can contact the investigating officer, Captain Van Beulen, at 071 481 3259. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

De Lille said on Monday the last 13 months had been a difficult period. “You can’t fight forever, that is something all of us have to admit to. Honestly this has never been about me. I have refused positions elsewhere and now I am walking away from the position of mayor. “I really just wanted my name cleared and then walk away from all of this.” After more than 10 months of mudslinging and court cases, the DA and De Lille decided to put an end to it with De Lille resigning, but retaining her DA membership and the party dropping all charges. De Lille made it clear no deal was reached with the DA. “There is the principle of innocent until proven guilty. It was the DA’s job to prove that I am guilty. My job was to prove my innocence. ” EFF provincial leader Bernard Joseph said: “She will now not be in the spotlight no more, but we will re-look the support we have for her. There are issues that we are not privy too, but it is clear that there was some deal she made with the DA leadership. They are in tatters, so in essence it’s their problem.” ANC City caucus leader Xolani Sotashe said: “We still want to see that allegations of corruption on various issues against De Lille are probed and tested in an open and credible process. We equally want other broader corruption allegations, including the water desalination plants.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

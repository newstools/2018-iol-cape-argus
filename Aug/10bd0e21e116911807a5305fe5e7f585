The academy delivered the first batch of new traffic officer graduates in 2012 and since then the academy has conducted 50 youth camps with 2058 learners from 93 schools across the metropole, and recruited 40 new cadets annually for the three-year curriculum. A satellite training venue was opened in Lakeside last year, along with a night school programme for law enforcement volunteers and staff employed through the Expanded Public Works Programme. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said the academy was instrumental in ensuring that the staff they deployed were up to the task. “Our academy had to accommodate a growing need for training as the various departments increase their numbers through permanent appointments.” The academy’s training achievements include, 410 peace officer training courses since inception, 131 traffic and metro policing qualifications since 2011, 8807 firearm refresher training slots since 2009 and 1069 students trained as peace officers and traffic wardens since 2014. The academy also implemented the youth cadet programme in 2012 through a series of youth camps, which operates as a flagship metro police social crime prevention programme. The training academy’s practical work component will include assisting as coaches for the youth cadet programme and working with instructors to implement the physical fitness base line assessment within the City’s safety and security directorate. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

In the first gruesome discovery, the body of 9-year-old Previledge Mabvongwe of Kraaifontein was found at a dump on Thursday morning. The police said murder and abduction cases were being probed. She was missing since Monday after returning from school. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the girl was still dressed in her school uniform when her body was found at the dumping site in Bloekombos. Late Thursday Rwexana said Nyanga police opened a case of abduction and murder after the body of an unidentified child was discovered in a shallow grave in the bushes near the N2. “A 32-year-old man was arrested and once he has been charged, he will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court,” she said. Mabvongwe was found days after her family launched a social media campaign asking for the public’s help. They received a call from someone who told them her body was found. The girl’s uncle Richard Mabvongwe said she was dropped off by her school transport about 100m away from her home, but she did not arrive at home. “Previledge was never an outgoing child, she always spent her time at home,” he said. She loved TV, he said. “She was a loving, kind and caring soul.” Previledge was a Grade 3 pupil at Scottsville Primary School. Provincial education department acting spokesperson Lorraine Botha, said the police were being urged to provide additional resources to assist in crime-fighting initiatives outside and around the school premises of vulnerable communities. “I want to bestow thanks to those community members who continue to be the eyes and ears on the ground, regardless of the ongoing violence in the communities that they live in,” said Botha. The police appealed to anyone with information in the Mabvongwe case to contact the investigating officer Loganathan Chetty at 082 522 1039, or Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or the nearest police station. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

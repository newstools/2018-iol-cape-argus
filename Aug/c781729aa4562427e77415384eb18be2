This comes just days after the chairperson and caretaker of the newly elected Hangberg interim community fishers board, Michael Baartman and Michelle Yon, respectively, alleged that Halim had been removed due to his misrepresentation of Hout Bay fishers. In an email received by the new committee of the board, the assistant director of the small scale fisheries management at the department, Bernacia Mullins, writes: “Based on the updated information provided regarding authorisation on the change of representation/caretaker, the majority vote of 50 (out of 91 interim relief fishers) was reached. “The department has concluded the review of the submitted request and acknowledge the change in representation for Hangberg.” The board was delighted by the news, commenting that it was a step in the right direction to fix the on-going issues in the Hout Bay fishing community. Halim said the original allegations made by the board, Baartman and Yon, were “not an accurate reflection of the reality”. An official announcement regarding the new caretakers is expected today, 24 August 2018. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The two officers were killed in separate incidents in Delft and Khayelitsha on Friday night. Lonwabo Kili, 30, was shot in Delft at around 8pm while picking up a friend. His firearm was taken. Siyamcela Ncipa, 37, was shot twice in the head outside a friend’s home in Site B, Khayelitsha. Police said he was also robbed of his firearm. Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula said police were working around the clock to track down the perpetrators. “The perpetrators of these two heinous incidents will be hunted down and they will face the might of the law. Detectives from the Hawks have taken over the investigations. Anyone with information about the two incidents that could assist the police investigation is urged to contact the police on 086 001 0111.” Kili’s family is grief stricken and is desperately searching for answers. His brother Xolisile Mqushulu described him as a caring soul, a man who devoted his life to taking care of his family, especially his wife and three children. “My brother never involved himself in violence, he loved people and he always prioritised education. He would always encourage young people to go to school.” Meanwhile, Parliament said that effective measures introduced by police management to ensure the safety of officers would be under scrutiny this week. “Once again the need by criminals to obtain firearms from law enforcement officers was the driving force for the attacks. Community members with information on the location of the perpetrators and the stolen firearms should contact and inform their nearest police station,” said Francois Beukman, chairperson of the portfolio committee on police. He said the lack of progress by SAPS with the implementation of a proactive national plan to install CCTV-cameras at police stations, the upgrading of perimeter fencing and the installation of secure entrance gates was of great concern to the committee. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

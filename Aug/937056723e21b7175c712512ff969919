Mayor Patricia de Lille addressed more than 130 women staying at or receiving support from 13 women’s shelters across the city. The City of Cape Town hosted the Western Cape Women’s Shelter Network for a lunch and open discussion about matters affecting women who recently left abusive relationships and were supported by shelters to build new lives. Employees from the City’s social services, housing, library services departments and employee programmes attended and provided information on how to access City services. “It is part of the Women’s Month celebration, I have invited them to comfort them and encourage them to walk away from abusive relationships. The shelters are doing lots of good work, but we need more shelters so we can encourage more women,” De Lille said. De Lille spoke about her resignation as the mayor of Cape Town. “Like many of you here I, too, started a new journey this month when I announced my resignation as mayor. “I would never want to make light of the struggle you have faced and the violence or trying circumstances you have endured but I, too, decided enough is enough,” she said. “The purpose of the Women’s Shelter Movement is to continue to advocate around women’s rights because we take care of abuse,” said event organiser Joy Lange. Many of the women who were present on Thursday were not only abuse victims but victims of rape, co-ordinator Delene Roberts said. “We render services to these women who experience trauma in rape and domestic violence and to their children.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

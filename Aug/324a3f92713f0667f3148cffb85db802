Today, Stellenbosch will host the provincial Female Entrepreneur Awards. Jointly organised by the National Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the provincial Department of Agriculture, the ceremony seeks to reward the efforts and contribution of women in job creation, economic growth and poverty alleviation. Previous winners have used the prize money to buy equipment and expand their business. The Western Cape produced several national winners during last year’s awards, and now all eyes are on the 2018 entrants, with particular focus on the women involved in the province’s wine industry. Alongside the Entrepreneur Awards, female winemakers will have the opportunity to showcase some of their work at the Women of Wine South Africa Festival on August 12. The event, held at Candlewoods Boutique Venue in Centurion, Gauteng, brings together some of South Africa’s finest female wine producers. One local representative is Stellenbosch University graduate, Lucinda Heyns, whose Illimis Wine has been critically acclaimed and enjoyed across the country. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

In this wonderful show of generosity, Indie has pledged that for every Indie Overcome policy sold via the Sunflower Fund, Indie will donate three times the first monthly premium to the charity. When asked why Indie had chosen to partner with the Sunflower Fund, Indie chief executive Peter Castleden said: “We want to focus on what our customer is living for, not just the risks they are trying to control for. “We believe that life insurance should be a force for both individual and social good, so it makes sense to align with an organisation that is fighting for the same things we are.” The Sunflower Fund supports patients who suffer from diseases such as sickle-cell anemia and leukaemia, covering costs of the HLA tissue-typing test involved in the recruitment of stem-cell donors, as well as providing awareness programmes and assisting patients who financially struggle to access transplants. Sunflower Fund chief executive Alana James stressed the importance of partnerships such as these which allow charities to continue their vital work. The number of stem-cell donors is a constant issue for the Sunflower Fund. “We encourage people between the ages of 18 and 45 with a weight of more than 50kg who are in general good health to consider registering as blood stem-cell donors. There is no cost to register and the process takes less than 10 minutes with a simple call to our call centre on 0800121082,” said James. Sunflower Day takes place on September 21. To mark the day, a public donor drive is taking place outside the Century City Hotel and Conference Centre.

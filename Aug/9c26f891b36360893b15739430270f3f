Disaster Risk Management Centre spokesperson Charlotte Powell said the centre had received numerous reports of flooded roadways and fallen trees after the heavy downpours and strong winds. “A total of 328 dwellings were affected, in SST Section, Greenpoint, Harare Section, Khayelitsha, and zone 20, Langa, where two dwellings built on a drain were completely damaged,” said Powell. She said requests had been sent to the Informal Settlements Department to provide plastic sheeting, flood kits and for possible relocation. Marikana informal settlement community leader Daluxolo Maki said that hundreds of informal structures and roadways had been affected. “Our community have stopped reporting floods to the disaster risk management centre because we report now and the following day we will be in floods again.” Veliswa Majiji said she lived with six people in an informal settlement. “We are not safe in this place. We need help,” she said. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

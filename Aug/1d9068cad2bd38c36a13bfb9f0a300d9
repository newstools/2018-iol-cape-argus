Geyser has planned a 50-day all-women expedition, driving a route from South Africa to Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana that will begin next month. This is not her first expedition. She embarked on a similar journey in 2016 when she, along with her crew at the time, raised funds and awareness regarding animal poaching, on a 100-day journey. Geyser said this September’s expedition, named “Journeys with Purpose: Rise of the Matriarch”, will focus on raising awareness about the human-wildlife conflict and promoting solutions for the sustainable co-existence of small communities and wildlife animals, particularly elephants and lions. In partnership with several organisations along the road, the women plan on spending two to three days on the ground with each organisation, working with them to provide schools and handing out a total of 30000 educational booklets. “I believe that Africa is ready for ladies, and there haven’t been too many only-female groups. It is something new. People see Africa as scary, but it is actually very welcoming, and its nice for ladies to know they can go out and explore it,” said Geyser. Her crew includes women from all over the world, including Spain and the US. Each is funding her own expenses, from food, to campsites, to fuel. Some have sponsorships, but all the funds raised throughout the expedition will go towards four causes: South Africa’s Elephants Alive, Namibia’s Endangered Species Trust, Botswana’s Eco-Exist Project and Zimbabwe’s Soft Foot Alliance Trust. “The expedition “is a little of putting your money where your mouth is,” said Geyser. “It is more worthwhile for people, especially women, to go out and do and see things themselves. So many people don’t know that we’re losing 90 elephants a day, or that pangolins are going extinct “It’s not for everyone, and it is emotionally draining, but it is a good cause.” @Nour__Sal  nour.sallam@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

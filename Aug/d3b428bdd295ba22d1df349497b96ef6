An ex-convict, Tshabalala run a classroom where he offers the youth free technical skills. His focus is on high school drop-outs, former prisoners and unemployed youth. Tshabalala is the founder of Quirky 30, a non-profit organisation with 24 students in training. In prison he taught English and maths to inmates. He said he drew inspiration from a question a fellow inmate had asked while he was busy teaching. “The inmate asked me to advise him on what he could do after being released from prison. That question got me thinking until I decided to start Quirky 30 organisation,” said Tshabalala. He thought about his life in the prison, and decided that he could not continue on the road he was on, he said. “I then realised that I needed to change people’s lives through education. “The rate of unemployment and seeing the youth of South Africa in and out of prison, because they have nothing to do, worried me. Stress and depression lead them to do bad things, such as crime,” said Tshabalala, who was convicted for armed robbery and cash-in-transit heists. He was 19 at the time. He was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment after being caught during an armed robbery at a Sea Point bottle store.

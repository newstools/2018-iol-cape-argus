It took place on Sunday at the Green Point Cricket Club and included two routes along the Sea Point Promenade, a 10km walk that started at 7.30am and a 5km walk that started at 8am. The starting point was on Fritz Sonnenberg Road next to the Cape Town Stadium. The Blisters for Bread Charity Family Fun Walk in association with Lucky Star celebrates its 50th anniversary. The first fun walk was organised in 1968 by 146 boys from Savio College in Lansdowne. The group of boys set out for a walk of 30.5km from Simonâ€™s Town to the school grounds in Lansdowne, each sponsored by firms or individuals. Heart transplant pioneer Professor Chris Barnard and Dr Philip Blaiberg, a heart transplant survivor, were among the sponsors to contribute to a total of R2644.62 raised in the first walk. The boys walked mostly in their school shoes, stopped for lunch in Muizenberg and made it home about five hours later. The entry fee was R60 which will enable the Peninsula School Feeding Scheme to provide 20 children with two nutritious meals for a day. Those who participated received a medal and an ice cold Coca-Cola. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

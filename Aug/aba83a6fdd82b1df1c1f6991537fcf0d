The beach clean-up was the launch event in the lead up to World Cleanup Day on September 15. Volunteers and stakeholders took part, grabbing their reusable gloves and striving towards a waste-free environment. Douw Steyn, director of sustainability at Plastics SA organised the event. Steyn said most of the litter that ends up polluting beaches is carried from rivers. “A lot of that can be recycled. We need to be able to raise awareness through these clean-ups, so that others don’t litter.” The volunteers collected bags of chips, plastic sticks, lollipops and water bottle lids among other things. Ambassador for Lets do it World Africa Marriette Hopely said the event was the launch of the annual World Cleanup Day where more than 6million volunteers partook in coastal and environmental clean-ups. “We need to strive towards a waste-free environment. “Because of the high tide, you could see that there is a lot of plastic and see the significant difference as we were leaving.” The event included speakers and stakeholders from the UN Environment Programme, the Department of Environmental Affairs, Plastics SA and United Religions Initiative among others, all participating to demonstrate their commitment to South Africa’s coastal environment. @Nour__Sal  nour.sallam@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

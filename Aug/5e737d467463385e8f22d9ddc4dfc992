The stem cell recruitment centre wants to create awareness about blood diseases and the importance of stem-cell donors. “Blood diseases have no respect of age, gender or race and the patients impacted cover a broad age spectrum and all race groups. “The fight against leukaemia and other blood diseases is all about you, your family, friends, peers and the community. “You can do something to make a difference to patients needing a blood stem cell transplant,” said Sunflower Fund chief executive Alana James. The organisations host an annual Sunflower Fund Day to raise awareness on the topic and this year’s campaign theme is “There is a hero in all of us”, which hopes to mobilised people. The fund will be selling Tube’s of Hope (Topes), a multi-purpose accessory which can be worn as a headband, mask, scarf, cap or armband to raise funds. The organisation hopes to sell 200000 Topes and are encouraging youngsters to get involved and join their school’s competition. Topes are available for R30 each at Pick n Pay stores, selected independent pharmacies or online at Zando during August and September. “To see our Topes worn with pride is a salute to our survivors, our fighters and our memories of loved ones. “It also serves as a reminder of our very critical goals, to ensure that South Africa has an ethnically diverse source of potential blood stem cell donors, who are committed to help save lives.” To find out more about the drive or to learn about how to get involved in the school’s competition, visit www.sunflowerfund.org.za. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

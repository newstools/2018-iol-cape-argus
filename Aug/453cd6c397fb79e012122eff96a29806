The farm, Watergang, part of the Louiesenhof Wine State, belongs to the family trust. The court case was postponed to August 29. This comes after hundreds of people from Kayamandi illegally occupied the farmland and named it Azania informal settlement. The family trust obtained an urgent interdict to remove unoccupied structures and to prevent more people from moving onto vacant space. Midas Wanana, speaking on behalf of the land occupants, said they had collected money among themselves to hire a lawyer to oppose the court action. “No matter what the court outcomes may be on August 29, we are not going anywhere. "We need President (Cyril) Ramaphosa to intervene,” said Wanana. The Louiesenhof Wine Estate landowner’s lawyer, Ernest van Staden, said: “The court needs to decide where are these people going to be placed.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

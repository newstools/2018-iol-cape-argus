Inspired by the collection Feminism Is, South Africans Speak Their Truth, a series of “Feminism Is” talks will interrogate ideas of feminism, gender, patriarchy, sexual health and ownership of the body. The first event, on September 5, Pumla Gqola, Dela Gwala and Thembekile Mahlaba chat to Sara-Jayne King, discussing their journeys to feminism and answering the public’s questions. On September 6, “The Listening Room” will be held as a safe place for attendees to share their personal experiences which shaped their feminist identities. It will only be open to persons of trans-experience and those who identify as women/womxn. Nicole Dennis-Benn, Angela Makholwa and Jackie Phamotse sit down with King in “This is Not A Blessing” to have an open discussion on transactional sex and power in their novels on September 7. “Motherhood” on September 8 hosts Martina Dahlmanns, Ijangolet Ogwang and Megan Ross discussing with Rachel Zadok unexpected motherhood and the complex issues of separation and adoption. Wrapping up on September 9, “Women Who Slay”, held at the Homecoming Centre Gallery, will have authors such as Mohale Mashigo (The Yearning) discussing heroes in and out of capes. The Open Book Festival runs from September 5-9, with other events taking place at the Fugard Theatre, D6 Homecoming Centre, The A4 Arts Foundation and The Book Lounge from 10am to 9pm each day. Ticket prices range from R45 to R180. While there are some free events, people are still advised to book online. Along with open discussion, the festival aims to instill a love of reading to its attendees. The Open Book School Library Project, in association with the festival, increases access to books for pupils and teachers. The project organised the placement of three book hand-overs to classes at Siyazingisa Primary School in Gugulethu and seven Open Boxes to St Mary’s Primary School in Cape Town. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The Saldanha Bay Municipality is the latest municipality to introduce a surcharge, which sets a minimum payment of R166 before electricity is supplied.But pressure from opposition parties has led to the municipality convening a special council meeting to address the impact of the electricity surcharges. Saldanha Bay mayor Marius Koen said the surcharges, calibrated according to the size of electricity meters, had been misunderstood. “There are customers who have conventional electricity accounts and then you get consumers with prepaid meters. The ones with prepaid meters are the ones who will be affected,” he said. Koen said electricity users with 30amp prepaid meters would be exempted from the surcharges, those with 40amp meters would be charged R166 a month, and those with 60amp meters R250 a month. “We need the revenue because in our towns we have people that come and visit only in holiday seasons, and that is about the only time we make sales of the prepaid boxes. We have also encouraged people to take a lower prepaid meter, which the municipality will cater for. Many households can work with a 30amp meter,” he said. Khoisan Defiance Campaign convener Sammy Claasen said the municipality had already pushed up water tariffs, and higher payments for electricity would push consumers to the brink. Claasen, also an ANC councillor, said political pressure forced the municipality to hold a special council meeting to address the issue. “We are refusing to accept this blatant exploitation of ratepayers. We will not allow this. The DA’s tariffs won’t be forced on us. This is not going through,” he said. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

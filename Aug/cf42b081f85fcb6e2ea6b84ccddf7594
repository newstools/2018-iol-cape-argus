The interfaith thanksgiving prayer service was hosted by Mayor Patricia de Lille and had leaders of the Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Khoisan and Catholic communities gather on the mountain. “We gathered here in May last year and the dams were only 20% full. We asked you to help us pray for rain and today, the dams are 60% full for the first time since 2016,” De Lille said. “We can safely say the drought has been broken. God has listened to us and we say thanks to God. “Never doubt that He is listening to us all the time. I also want to express thanks to team Cape Town for saving water,” she added. De Lille said water usage in Cape Town had decreased from 1.1 billion litres a day in 2016, to 500 million litres. This was a world first, she added, thanks to prayer and due diligence of Capetonians. Director of the South African Faith and Family Institute, Elizabeth Peters, said it was by God’s grace that dams were now 60% full. Lewies said God was initially cross with the residents of Cape Town because immediately after the religious leaders prayed for rain on the mountain last year, God sent a dangerous storm. “God was not happy with our sins. The name of Cape Town means where clouds were born,” added Lewies. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

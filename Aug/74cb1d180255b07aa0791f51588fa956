The programme provides its learners the necessary principles of mechanics such as safe operation practices; performing mechanical and electrical repairs and maintenance; engine rebuilding; diagnostics, fault-finding and inspection procedures. The women, trained in practical and theoretical work, will be equipped for a trade certificate that leads to an NQF Level 4 qualification. The programme requires the completion of a semester at City workshops, and another at Northlink College. In addition to mechanics, the Fleet Management department will provide the women with additional skills including driver training, computer literacy and basic office administration. According to Stuart Diamond, mayoral committee member for Assets and Facilities Management, this promotes versatility and a higher sense of job satisfaction. He added: “This will lead to increased productivity and improves service delivery.” In light of Women’s Month, Diamond said: “It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the contribution from the women. I tip my hat to them for participating in the scarce skills programme which has been a predominantly male environment. "With the spotlight on the empowerment of women in the workforce, it is becoming increasingly clear that the City is encouraging an increase in opportunities for women across all workplaces." @Nour__Sal  nour.sallam@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

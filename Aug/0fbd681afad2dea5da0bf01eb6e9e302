The initiative, an annual event, saw more than 20 female officers conduct searches on vehicles, engage with road users, provide safety tips, and hand out pamphlets and stationery. According to Senior Superintendent Zelda Martin of the metro police, female officers from the Athlone cluster took part in the initiative, which was organised by Annalene Marais, deputy chief of the metro police. “In line with Women’s Month, we thought that it was best that female officers be out and about, doing the roadblocks themselves,” said Martin. “It’s not always that women are highlighted in this field, because it is male-dominated. “This (initiative) is held to strengthen our women and show them that we are capable of doing roadblocks without the help of male officers.” Female traffic officers inspected numerous vehicles to determine their roadworthiness, checked whether drivers had their licences, that babies were strapped in child seats, and issued fines. Marais said: “We know these roadblocks yield great results. As a department we have made great strides in promoting women empowerment across different areas, including law enforcement and traffic management. We are confident that upcoming operations and activities will make a difference. We cannot tackle road carnage on our own; road users should exercise caution and take all basic safety measures.” Roadblocks would be set up in various parts of the Western Cape, and women would enforce the law vigorously beyond Women’s Month, sending a clear message that lawlessness would not be tolerated on roads throughout the year. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

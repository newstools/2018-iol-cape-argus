The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the 12-year-old child, will remain in custody and the case has been postponed to September 4 for a bail application. A group of angry community members gathered outside the court, chanting songs, calling for “the rapist” to be released to them, so that they can deal with him. Among the community members was the mother of the child who was raped, who was blamed by the community, saying she knew about “the child rape” and she was being paid for it. The mother said, “I am being accused of knowing about this, because my child was left to stay with my sister for reasons that I do not know and I did not ask.” She said the child stole her sister’s money amounting to R5000. When the child was confronted, she told them how she use to receive money “from the rape accused”. “I never anticipated that this could happen. The man is a very humble man who loved to be around children,” said the mother. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

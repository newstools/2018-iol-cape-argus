Maude Modise, 28, is Shoprite’s financial manager at its distribution centre in Gauteng, and describes herself as a “fearless woman”. Modise said the retail industry was dynamic. “I have the ability to lend an ear and mentor young aspiring professionals. I’m able to offer advice based on my own experiences. “I believe the future of our country lies in the hands of young people. This is why I strive to listen and learn from them while still sharing what I’ve learnt along the way.” She is originally from the North West. “After matriculating, I was accepted to North West University and was awarded a bursary with The Shoprite Group in my second year. In 2017, after much hard work, I qualified as a chartered accountant.” She said women still faced many challenges in the workplace. “There are so many sectors, particularly finance, that are still male dominated and in order to overcome this more companies need to make it part of their culture to mentor and groom women. I’m fortunate to work for one such company where mentorship programmes are emphasised.” Gauteng Checkers Hypers’ deputy divisional manager Michelle Botha said: “After completing matric, I did not know what to do and my dad said I should study to become a physiotherapist. I instead worked in retail during the vacation and loved it very much. Eighteen years later I still enjoy what I am doing. My dad was diagnosed with cancer last year, when I became Checkers Hyper’s divisional manager. He died last year, but I am sure that he would have been proud today.” Botha, originally from KwaZulu-Natal, said she started out as a training administration manager at Shoprite 18 years ago. She said women still faced challenges in the work place and that the retail sector was still dominated by men, “but women are also making huge contributions”. “Today when we sit in board meetings it is nice to see more women in the boardroom.” @RusanaPhilander rusanaphilander1@gmail.com Cape Argus

Mondayâ€™s meeting was attended by SAHRC commissioner Chris Nissen, the sheriff of the court, police and land grabbers. Municipality spokesperson Stuart Grobbelaar said an independent audit of occupiers of the illegal structures would be undertaken by the municipality and the legal processes must continue without any interference. It was agreed that existing municipal projects and service delivery in the area would continue with immediate effect and without interference and no new structures would be erected. Nissen said a joint monitoring committee would monitor and ensure that no new structures were erected in the area and that the municipality continued with efforts to acquire land. This meeting comes after hundreds of people from Kayamandi illegally occupied the farmland and named it Azania informal settlement. The community urged the municipality to at least assist them with water and toilets. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

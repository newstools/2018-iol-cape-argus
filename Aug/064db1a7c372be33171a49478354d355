Chinonso Pascal Eze, 33, and Pamella Mendrew, 26, appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on charges of fraud. The couple was arrested by the Hawks’ serious commercial crime investigation unit a week ago. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said that during the arrest Hawks officers seized a vehicle, cellphones, bank cards and statements suspected to be the proceeds of crime. The State prosecutor told the court that the State would be opposing bail. He said the State believed that the two were running a 419 scam. The case was remanded to September 18 for formal bail application proceedings. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

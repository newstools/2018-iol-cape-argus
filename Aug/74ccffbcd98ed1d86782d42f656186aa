May and the delegation met with President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week for a business meeting. May also addressed an investment summit in the city. Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said May highlighted the economic potential in Africa and pledged to boost investment on the continent. “Prime Minister May’s plans to boost investment on the continent to create jobs is exactly in line with what we are trying to achieve here in the Western Cape. “We also welcome her confirmation that the UK intends to carry over the European Union’s (EU) Economic Partnership Agreement with the Southern African Customs Union once the EU deal no longer applies to the UK,” he said. May said: “From the Western Cape to the Mediterranean come stories of increasing stability, growth, innovation and hope.” Members of the delegation also met with Western Cape government partners Green Cape and Wesgro to discuss the green economy and trade opportunities. Green Cape chief executive Mike Mulcahy said opportunities were discussed as evolving within South Africa’s water, waste, energy and agricultural sectors. “We were proud to share our 2018 market intelligence reports which elucidates many of these opportunities in some detail. “There was also a meaningful conversation about skills and re-skilling strategies for coal miners, a challenge Wales faced many years ago - and one South Africa will face over the coming years as we move to a lowest cost, low-carbon energy future,” Mulcahy said. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

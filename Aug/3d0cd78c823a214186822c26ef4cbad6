This after she told them at the gates of Parliament at the end of their march from Keizersgracht Street in District Six that she was accepting their memorandum on behalf of the Speaker, Baleka Mbete. Mbete was expected to accept the memorandum but didn’t pitch. “I am an official from Parliament. I have been requested to come and do this today. “I am not a politician, and therefore if I am sent and receive this memorandum on behalf of the Speaker, that is what I am supposed to do,” Mohlomi said. Demonstrators chanted: “We want the Speaker,” while others accused the government of not caring about the safety of women in the country.        Hundreds participated in the march, taking to the streets from the early hours. “This march is significant because South Africa is a country with high femicide rates, high rates of cases where women and children and gender non-conforming people are at the receiving end,” said organiser Misa Makwakwa Masokameng. Among the demonstrators was DA MP Phumzile van Damme. “We want to take what has been said here to Parliament to speak loudly about women’s issues that are always in the back seat,” she said. Van Damme has had her own experience of being mocked by men in Parliament. In 2017, ANC MP Mervyn Dirks called her a “straatmeid” (street maid). Van Damme said: “I have been mocked and called names, but all it does is it strengthens my resolve and pushes me to fight for the people of this country.”        Members of the LGBTIQ+ community called on government to do more to protect them. “I don’t feel safe in our streets as a queer male. I need to stand my ground along with other women here who don’t feel safe,” Ricky Girnun said. Similar marches took place in Pretoria and Durban and in neighbouring countries. The organisation is demanding that Parliament form a special unit to deal with gender-based violence. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

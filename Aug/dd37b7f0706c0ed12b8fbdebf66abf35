The sod-turning event was attended by the MEC for Human Settlements, Bonginkosi Madikizela, together with Muzzamil Toefy, spokesperson for the developer POVICOM, in Weltevreden Valley. “People earning between R1 500 and R15 000 a month would benefit from this project. The department hopes to use the Regent Villas Project as a catalyst and roll it out to other areas across the city,” said Madikizela. “It is crucial for the government to invest in infrastructure and projects of this nature because the aim is not only to house people but to create job opportunities for young people in construction,” Madikizela said. This project will focus more on the people who are living in Mitchells Plain, mostly the low-income earners and backyarders. Toefy said the appeal of the project was that rental would range between R700 and R4500 per month. “Beneficiaries will get 24-hour security, a recreation area, a shop and a parking area. We want people to have a place not only where they can stay, but a secure space where they can enjoy their lives. This is the very first triple-storey social housing development for the entire Mitchells Plain,” said Toefy. The construction phase 1 of the Regent Villas Social Housing Project is expected to begin next month and is estimated to be completed in September next year. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

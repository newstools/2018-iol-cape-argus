City councillors Grant Twigg and Angus McKenzie, mayco member for water and sanitation Xanthea Limberg and deputy mayor Ian Neilson are all in the running to take over from De Lille. One of De Lille’s fiercest critics, JP Smith, has taken himself out of the running for De Lille’s post saying he is best suited as a “behind the scenes guy”. Plato, who was succeeded by De Lille in 2011, said he was approached, but would not be drawn on whether he would accept a nomination. “I have also seen various names of candidates. There was a strong focus on the premier (Helen Zille) and several other names. Normally the party leadership contacts the relevant person or persons and up until that moment, I am not going to speculate on anything,” Plato said. Twigg, also chairperson of the DA metro region, said he had been approached by fellow DA members to apply for the position. “I have been asked, but really I am fit to serve wherever the party feels I am fit to run. I am not chasing any position, but if the party believes I am fit to serve in whatever capacity I will do so,” he said. Limberg, mayoral committee member for water and sanitation, would not be drawn on the future prospects. “As far I am aware the process hasn’t started,” she said referring all other questions to the DA leadership. Premier Helen Zille, according to reports, confirmed that she has also been approached, but is set on finishing her term as premier. DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, who was first touted to take over from De Lille, is out of the running as he is a candidate to take over from Zille. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

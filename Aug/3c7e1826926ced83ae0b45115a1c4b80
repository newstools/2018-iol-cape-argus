Around 35 pupils, aged 14 to 17, have come together to create the band. Only two years on from the formation of the group, Spine Road High are already a major player in the Western Cape competition, and are slowly establishing themselves as one of the most skilful school marching bands in the country. Recently competing in the SAPS Nelson Mandela Annual Marching Band Competition, the school claimed four trophies: a second place in the drum line category and third places in exhibition, best dress and overall points. Spine Road also claimed the highest position of all Western Cape entrants. The head of sport at the school, Shafik Murphy, could not contain his pride: “The band won four out of a possible six trophies, which is a fantastic achievement for a school like ours. The kids turn up over the weekend for practice. Whatever time, they turn up at a moment’s notice. It’s great.” The school, which celebrated a 100% matric pass rate last year, is committed to establishing sport at the centre of education. With enthusiastic teaching staff, Murphy believes it is well on track to reaching their goal: “We believe that the students should have 30-40% sport, and the rest academics.” “We have successful teams in men’s and women’s rugby, soccer and netball - other schools are worried when they play a Spine Road team!”   Unfortunately for these talented students, access to funding is still proving difficult for the school. Chairperson Abraham Fransman explained that “generous parents” of the marching band pupils were footing a lot of the competing costs themselves. To help: 0213929463. The next tournament for the band is scheduled for October 13, when Mitchells Plain will welcome schools from Port Elizabeth to compete in the Mitchells Plain SAPS Tournament. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

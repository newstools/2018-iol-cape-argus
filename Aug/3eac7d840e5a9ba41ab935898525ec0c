The school caters to 1205 pupils but only receives approximately 6% of their fees a year. Staff and pupils pull together to hold fund-raisers to make up for the shortfall needed to buy books and equipment. The school will be hosting a Trip Around the World Food Fair, a book sale and a Newspaper Day on Friday to reach their fund-raising goal, and they’re appealing to the public and businesses to get involved and assist them. “There is a shortage of funds because of unemployment, so not all parents pay school fees. “When we raise funds, we set ourselves a goal. “We need computers in the library for learners to do research and to improve our system of distributing books. We’re doing it manually. “Our parents always support us and we hope the broader community will also support us to improve quality of education for our learners,” said school principal, Gregory Kannemeyer. The Newspaper Day, along with the book sale, will be hosted to get pupils and the community excited about reading and seeing newspapers as a vital source of information. The day will then culminate with the Trip around the world Food Fair which will celebrate food from various nations including South Africa, India, France, Italy and America. Platters will be sold for R200. Businesses are encouraged to donate money or ingredients, as the food would be made by the school’s home economics class.

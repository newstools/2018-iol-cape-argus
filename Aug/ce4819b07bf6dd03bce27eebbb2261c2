It is one of Poland’s most famous and beautiful tall ships. Built in 1982, it is about 50m tall and 95m long. Deputy Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga welcomed the ship at the Waterfront. Partaking in the Independence Sail, for which preparations began in 2017, the ship will commemorate Poland’s independence by visiting 22 ports over the course of 10 months. The crew plans to return to Poland on March 28, 2019. The Polish tall ship sailed to, among others, Tallinn, Copenhagen, Stavanger, Bremenhaven, Bordeaux, Tenerife, Dakar, Mauritius, Jakarta, Singapore, Shanghai, Osaka and will also dock at San Francisco, Los Angeles, Acapulco, Panama, Miami, Ponta Delgada and London. Events marking and celebrating the 100th anniversary of Poland’s regained independence will be held in each of the 22 visited ports. Meetings with the Polish diaspora are also envisaged. During its 10-month cruise, approximately 1000 people will be involved in manning the tall ship, around 600 of them being maritime students from the northern Polish cities of Gdynia and Szczecin. The remaining participants won their spots on the ship in a competition which tested their knowledge about Polish history and naval science. The ship will be open for viewing today from 10am to 1pm. @Nour__Sal  nour.sallam@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

A video shared on social media showed the security guards kicking two men, one in possession of a camera, who fell onto the floor, as they both received blows. Another bystander joined the brawl which saw more security personal running to the scene. According to Cape Peninsula University of Technology spokesperson Lauren Kansley, the scuffle erupted between freelance photographers who were warned to stop operating on campus after not receiving accreditation. “We are aware of a video being circulated on social media. At the time, the photographers in the video did not have the appropriate accreditation to operate on campus. “The service providers used during graduation have all been vetted through stringent processes. This is to avoid students and loved ones being taken advantage of by unscrupulous characters.” Kansley said the matter has since been resolved and campus security will be compiling a report on the incident.   athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

The expedition team were conducting sea trials for three days in Cape Town, to test the research equipment. SA Agulhas II is one of the largest and most modern polar research vessels in the world. There are areas of the Weddell sea that are covered with ice and the SA Agulhas II is a specialised vessel that will be able to sail through the areas of frozen water, explained John Sears, Voyage leader for the Weddell Sea expedition. The planning of the voyage took months of organisation, said Knowledge Bengu, Captain of the SA Agulhas II. All research will take place in the Weddell Sea in Antarctica. The team will investigate the effects of climate change and global warming. Modern technological systems are set for the expedition, such as the drones, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which will be used for collecting data under the sea. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus

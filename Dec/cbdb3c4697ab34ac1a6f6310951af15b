Johannesburg - The organisers of the Global Citizen Festival and House of Mandela are "deeply disturbed" by the reports of criminal activity against music fans as they tried to leave the FNB Stadium on Sunday night. "The safety of our guests is always of paramount importance to us and we understand and empathise with their hurt and anger. In the spirit of the global citizen movement, we believe in holding power to account and therefore we urge the South African Police Services to act swiftly and efficiently.” It is believed that music lovers were mugged and traumatised by suspects. Many took to social media to express disgust at the ride-hailing company, Uber, after they were left stranded as the Uber app and website crashed. Some Uber drivers have hiked up the prices of trips up to R1000. The company later apologised for the inflated trip prices saying "We are aware that some riders were charged more than usual for rides taken from the Global Citizen concert last night, and we apologise for this. Due to a variety of complexities, such as network coverage issues and mismanaged event traffic flow at the venue (both of which were out of our control), last night we switched on dynamic pricing." Uber also vowed to refund riders who were charged extra on their trips.

The station will serve the Samora Machel community, following an outcry from its members that population growth and spatial development in the area necessitated the establishment of another police station in the township. Community members applauded as Cele cut the ribbon. Resident Angelina Mtalana, 63, said the station brought relief to the community: “I hope there will be a decrease in crime The festive season is almost upon us again. “We feel free, excited, because the station comes at a perfect time.” The Nyanga police station recorded 308 murders from April last year to March this year, the highest number out of all police stations in South Africa. Cele said the new facility will alleviate the case load from Nyanga police station, with 16 extra personnel and 54 vehicles allocated to Samora Machel. He signed a pledge and presented the station to the almost 40000-strong community. Its station commander is Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot Lingani.      Nyanga CPF chairperson Martin Makhasi said residents were excited: “This is going to make a difference in our community. We needed this station. Our residents had to travel a long distance to the Nyanga police station. Some had to hire private vehicles.” Social Justice Coalition (SJC) welcomed the opening of the new police station. SJC general secretary Axolile Notywala said it was an important step to providing greater safety, security and justice for people living in the Nyanga police precinct. Community Safety MEC Alan Winde said the new station was a victory for the Western Cape government and its residents, as Nyanga was synonymous with being the murder capital of the country. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

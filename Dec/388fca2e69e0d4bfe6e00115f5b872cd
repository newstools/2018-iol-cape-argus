On Tuesday, Acting Judge Melanie Holderness said the State had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. She found Simbarashe guilty of all seven counts against him, including murder and housebreaking with intent. Simbarashe was accused of stabbing 24-year-old Lewis while she was seeking refuge at the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children in Manenberg. Lewis had been living at the centre for just over a month when Simbarashe tracked her down and killed her on October 9, 2015. On the fatal day, Lewis was shopping at Pick and Save Superette when Simbarashe entered the shop and grabbed her. He stabbed Lewis 34 times. In his defence, Simbarashe said he did not recall all the events. Acting Judge Holderness said she didn't accept Simbarasheâ€™s version that he couldn't remember committing the offences and that he suffered from mental illness. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus

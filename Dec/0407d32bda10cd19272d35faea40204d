Three suspects Russel Stanton Jonathan (53), Mark Overmeyer (51) and Zaynisa Alfoz (45) were also apprehended in various parts of Cape Town for their alleged involvement on the drugs seized at the storage facility. All the suspects have been remanded in custody. In a second incident, the Hawks’ George and Cape Town Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB ) together with the provincial Crime Intelligence team arrested two people, aged 60 and 27, in a coordinated police operation while they were offloading an assortment of illegal drugs worth approximately R8.6 million into a storage facility in Somerset West. Tik and mandrax drugs were allegedly found inside the suspects’ vehicle and the storage unit, including two elephant tusks and a note counter machine. All the items have been seized. The team proceeded to the suspects residence in Wetton, Cape Town, and the subsequent search of the suspects home, the authorities found and confiscated further drugs worth about R810 000, an undisclosed amount of money and another vehicle. Provincial spokesperson for the Hawks, Captain Philani S. Nkwalase, has stated that while the cases are different, they cannot rule out anything yet. "Both cases are separate and the suspects are totally different. At this stage the investigation is on-going, we cannot rule out any possibilities but for now these matters are unrelated." theolin.tembo@inl.co.za Cape Argus

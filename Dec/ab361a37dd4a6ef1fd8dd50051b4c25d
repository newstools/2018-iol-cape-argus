The “Ladies and Diamonds” evening will give them the chance to win prizes at the new venue at 220 Long Street. Guests can expect a special live performance by model, singer and producer Gold Watermelon, who is from Kimberley. Johnson, the host for the night, encourages all to come dressed in their best smart-casual outfit. “Being sexy is all about your state of mind - fashion should be gorgeous but not restrict you on the night as you will be boogying your heart out,” says Johnson. Doors open at 8pm and on arrival guests can experience the One World Decor pop-up shop. Prize give-aways will begin shortly after doors open. Entry is R50. An all-male line-up of DJs will provide entertainment. “We are also not excluding our male counterparts so guys are most welcome to join, but just know the spoils are aimed at our ladies,” said Johnson. Sponsors came on board in support of this event, and include Strawberry Lips Tequila, Tosca Hair and Beauty salon, Lachet, Fashion Silueta, Wet n Wild South Africa, Impress Nails South Africa, Ageless Faces, Bobbi Brown cosmetics and One World Decor. miche.edwards@inl.co.za Cape Argus

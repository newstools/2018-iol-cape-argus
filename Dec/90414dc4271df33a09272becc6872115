Last week there was an uproar over the City’s plans to fine owners of solar panels if they failed to register their devices. Now, as this newspaper reported on Monday, a suspended City official gets paid R250 000 a month for sitting at home. Melissa Whitehead, commissioner for transport and urban development, was suspended in January pending the outcome of a probe into allegations of improper conduct. With seemingly no urgency to conclude, there’s no indication how long Whitehead’s hearing will take. Next month she would have received about R3 million - paid by Cape Town ratepayers. It is outrageous that the so-called best-run city preaches financial prudence but folds its arms as ratepayers get skinned. This may be more than wasteful expenditure. It may be sign of how much Capetonians are being taken for granted. It may a sign of utter disrespect to the people of this city. Peace. * Aziz Hartley, Cape Argus editor. ** To comment on this story, write to arglet@inl.co.za. Responses must include full names, addresses, and contact details (not for publication). Cape Argus

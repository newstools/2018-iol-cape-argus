The chairperson of the Greater Vredehoek Heritage Action Group, Charl de Villiers, said HWC’s built environment and landscape committee had confirmed it would look at the application to demolish the café on December 12. The meeting would be open to the public and would be held in the city centre. A property developer wants to replace the café, situated on Deer Park Drive, with a four-storey, 31-apartment building. De Villiers is heading a campaign against the demolition of the café, which is in a 60-year-old building. He said although the “small centre does not appear to be particularly conservation-worthy in its own right, any changes can cause irreversible degradation to its surrounding social and built fabrics”. The concerns are similar to those that the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association is having with property developer Blok, which has plans for the site of the former St Monica's Old Age Home, in Lion Street, in the Bo-Kaap. Blok and the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association are to confront each other in the Western Cape High Court tomorrow. The association is challenging an interdict that Blok has taken out against the community to prevent protests at its site. De Villiers said the café was next to a municipal park and offered a “well-frequented playground”. “It has evolved into a thriving social space where enterprising and publicly spirited residents and businesses host a market and music events, which are liable to sit uneasily with the proposed residential development,” said De Villiers. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

Cape Town - The levels of the dams which supply Cape Town declined by 0,9% over the past week to 69,5 % of storage capacity. This is compared to dam levels of 34,3% at the same time last year. The average water consumption decreased by 22 million litres per day to 541 million litres per day for the past week, which is well within the Level 3 usage range of 650 million litres of collective usage per day. Level 3 recovery restrictions give some relief to residents and business, while advocating for continued water-wise usage as it is difficult to predict the rainfall that Cape Town will receive in 2019 and 2020. Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC, Anton Bredell, said levels continuing to drop for this time of year is expected. “The warmer weather and increased demand over the coming months will be sure to affect the levels even further. At the moment our major dams across the largest part of the province remain in good shape but we want to urge continued responsibility when it comes to water usage over the summer months. The best time to save water is when you have it.” In addition, the minister has cautioned the public to be particularly water and fire safe over the holiday season. “This time of year there is a lot of activity around open water areas including inland, around dams and rivers and private pools. Please be careful and keep a watchful eye at all times on young children who may be around open water areas, in order to avoid tragedy as far as possible," Bredell said. "In addition, the risk of runaway wildfires in the Western Cape is still very high and we ask for everyone’s help to prevent fires. Please use the number 112 to report any emergency that may come up. Our officials will be on hand to assist, but prevention is always better than cure. We certainly wish all our locals and visitors a safe and happy holiday period.” Major Dam statistics   Please see the following links for information on:

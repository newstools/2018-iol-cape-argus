Cape Town - Tiny hands grasped at air and widened eyes peered curiously at new surroundings at the Mowbray Maternity Hospital, as baby Zyon Hans entered the world on Christmas Day. Zyon was the first of 138 babies – 79 boys, 55 girls and two sets of twin boys – to be born on Christmas Day in the Western Cape’s public hospitals. First-time mom Mishe Jaftha from Retreat said she was overjoyed that her son was the first of the children to be born on Christmas Day. “The 24th was my check-up date and they said the baby would come after the 31st, but the whole week I could feel that the baby was coming soon. I went home and took a nap. At around 1am, I started feeling pain in my lower back and it started getting stronger. I told my aunt and she said ‘the baby is coming here for Christmas’. I was excited because I wanted the baby to come on Christmas Day.” Jaftha said giving birth was a painful experience, but it was worth it to introduce her beautiful boy, Zyon, to the family. “He sleeps most of the time but wakes up almost every half-hour for me to feed him. I named him Zyon after a gospel song I heard.” Father, Bradley Hans said the moment his son was born he felt indescribable joy, and he believed Zyon’s birth was a Christmas miracle. Western Cape department of health spokesperson Maret Lesch said the first three Christmas babies were born in close succession in public hospitals: Zyon was born eight minutes after midnight, a girl at nine minutes after midnight and another boy a minute later at Tygerberg Hospital. The two sets of twins were both born at New Somerset Hospital. “I would like to congratulate all new parents on the birth of their babies on this very special day. Remember that the first 1 000 days of a child’s life are very important. Provide them with a safe environment and good nutrition,” said Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo. The department thanked all hospital staff for their hard work and dedication on Christmas Day. athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

Sitole’s spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said: “The utterances attributed to the national commissioner are untrue. They are clearly aimed at portraying him in a negative light as well as undermining excellent collaboration between the SAPS and the community in the fight against crime.” These continuous fake news postings should be condemned in the strongest possible way,  he said. The social media story quoted Sitole as having said “white people brought crime to South Africa”. Naidoo said: “SAPS call on all who have published, seen, or received the false news article to ignore the message and to refrain from sharing or disseminating false information”.

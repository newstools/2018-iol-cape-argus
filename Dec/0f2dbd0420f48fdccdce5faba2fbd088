Johannesburg- Stadium Management South Africa (SMSA) are calling for an investigation following the chaotic scenes that unfolded after the Global Citizen Concert in Johannesburg on Sunday. On 20 November 2018 and again on 4 December 2018, Stadium Management SA’s attorney submitted a letter to the Minister of Sport & Recreation, Thokozile Xasa, regarding the proposed Judicial Commission of Enquiry into safety and security at events in South Africa. In the letter sent on Monday to the minister SMSA said: “The widespread criminality and abuse of members of the public and spectators which took place in the immediate precinct of FNB Stadium and nearby surrounds of the NASREC precinct after the Global Citizen Concert staged at the FNB Stadium on Sunday 2 December 2018, has prompted my client to once again address you with reference to the proposed Judicial Commission of Enquiry into Football in South Africa.” On Sunday over 90 000 festival-goers gathered at the FNB stadium for the Global Citizen Festival in honour of former president Nelson Mandela and struggle icon Albertina Sisulu. The concert ended at around 23h00 after international singer Beyonce and rapper Jay-Z performed. After their performance chaos broke out as reports of muggings and violence surfaced at a nearby petrol station SMSA has also announced that they will be looking into the security around the stadium. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

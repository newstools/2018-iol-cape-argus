The girls who attend the school come from various underprivileged communities and Perry addressed the girls and their parents on the importance of being selected to attend the institute, which assists marginalised girls to access world-class opportunities. “Before the ceremony this morning, I spoke to Ms Winfrey and asked her how she chose the girls. She said she looks for something special, something that sparkles and is unique. “Today that’s all I saw. I saw all the hope, brilliance and intelligence. Being the chosen one is special and wonderful. It gives you the opportunity to strive and go higher and do things that you would have not had the chance to do,” said Perry. The ceremony saw the academy’s top achievers, such as Nicolle Naidoo and Anele Satsa, being recognised for their academic and leadership capabilities. The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Award was given to a student who epitomised leadership, caring, and generosity and was awarded to Lethukukhanya Mbambo. “It is such an honour and privilege to exist in a space where you can become more than you were yesterday,” said the 2018 Class Representative, Khensani Hlaise. “For my sisters and me, this journey has been of becoming more of ourselves, it has been about uncovering and discovering, a journey of shedding our fears and becoming who we truly have always been. “We are all here because of a dream that Mum O had, one that Tata Madiba pushed along.” The 2018 class saw 58 girls graduate from the Academy.

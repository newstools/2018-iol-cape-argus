Cape Town - Cooler weather could not deter thousands of people from flocking to the City’s beaches to celebrate Boxing Day on Wednesday. The City reported that by 2pm there were roughly 20 000 people at beaches and swimming pools. “The number of people has not been massive this year. This is mostly due to the weather. “We have not increased the number of our deployment, but our officials are working tirelessly to maintain order,” mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said. “Our resources dwindle at night, and this is where at some beaches things get out of hand. “What we are planning on doing is extending our staff’s hours of working, but that in itself is a recipe for disaster because our staff are armed and it becomes difficult to manage people in the dark. It puts our staff’s safety at risk.” Mayoral committee member for community services and health Zahid Badroodien said: “We have more than 300 lifeguards on duty at our beaches, but visitor safety is a team effort. “We are also implementing the Identikidz project at 14 beaches until after the peak festive season period, so I urge caregivers to register their children as soon as they arrive at any one of the participating beaches. That way, we can ensure a quick reunion in the event that the child is separated.” Alcohol remains a problem on our beaches and the high numbers of confiscations bear testimony, City Law Enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said. “From the start of the festive season to Thursday last week, more than 4 458 bottles – translating into 2 780.37 litres – were confiscated on Cape Town beaches.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

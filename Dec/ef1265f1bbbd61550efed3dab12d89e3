Concerned residents, the operators of Deer Park Café, and the Friends of Rocklands Park, have opposed the demolition. The owner of the café, Roger van Wyk, said: “Neither the owner nor the developer engaged the restaurant in advance of the demolition application and no long-term arrangements have been made with any of the restaurant owners in relation to their tenure after the demolition. No arrangements have been mooted or put in place for the preservation of Rocklands Park, which adjoins Deer Park Café. Some argue an alternative would be for HWC (Heritage Western Cape) to impose appropriate conditions in connection with any demolition permission. These would reasonably curtail the size, height and bulk of the proposed building so it will not loom over the park.” The owner said the landlord of the property, Liad Property Trust, is working with Signatura Property Development to build a four-storey high-rise apartment block with basement parking. Chairperson of the Greater Vredehoek Heritage Action Group Charl de Villiers said the centre was not conservation-worthy. He said changes can cause irreversible degradation to its surrounding social and built fabrics. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

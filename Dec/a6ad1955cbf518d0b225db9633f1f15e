Case - who authored Love, David and 92 Queens Road, among other books - was stabbed three days into the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign by a 31-year-old man she was trying to help get back on his feet. The man, who attacked her in her vehicle, faces a charge of attempted murder and was due to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Monday. However, the case was postponed to Thursday, December 20. Case said the only reason she survived was because she fought back. “We don't want him to get bail, especially for a crime of this nature, during the 16 Days of Activism. “Part of my face is numb because he cut through nerves and blood vessels but I'm living today because I fought for my life. I am still fighting back. The worst thing is that my family is traumatised and I hate seeing the fear in my family's faces,” said Case. Case said that apart from the physical injuries she endured, her vehicle also incurred damages to the value of about R32000 when her attacker drove off with her vehicle. She remains positive, however, and said she wants to focus on men being put away for the terrible scourge of violence in society which sees women being victimised. Case's friend, Jessie Savage, said Case has many family members and friends supporting her and they will continue to oppose bail against the accused, to help set a precedent of no bail for those who abuse women. athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

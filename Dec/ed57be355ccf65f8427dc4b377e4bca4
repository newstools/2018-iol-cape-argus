The SA Weather Service said the province would experience fine, cloudy and cool weather along the south-west and south coast and adjacent interior, with isolated to scattered showers on Thursday morning, lingering along the south coast into the afternoon, otherwise partly cloudy and warm. But despite the weather, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) worked tirelessly on Cape Town’s beachfronts. In the early hours of yesterday morning the NSRI was alerted by a dive charter boat reporting to be heading towards Shelly Beach with a dive crew on board. A 65-year-old Krugersdorp man was reported to have stopped breathing during a scuba dive. “The man was recovered on to the dive charter boat and the dive charter crew initiated CPR and raised the alarm, alerting the NSRI station at Shelly Beach, who responded to meet the boat on arrival,” said NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon. On the boat’s arrival at Shelly Beach, paramedics continued with advanced life support CPR, but they were unable to resuscitate the man. The man’s body was taken into the care of the Forensic Pathology Services and police have opened an inquest docket. The City’s law enforcement were also busy - they have made at least 337 arrests for driving under the influence so far this December, according to Safety and Security director Richard Bosman. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

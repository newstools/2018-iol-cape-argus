“The previous mayoral committee member has been liaising with the National Housing Development Agency (NHDA) to discuss mechanisms for the acquisition of critical parcels of government-owned land, among which is the large parcel of land adjacent to Bo-Kaap that belongs to the national government. “The discussions about this land parcel have been ongoing for a number of years now, without any progress to date,” said Felicity Purchase, the City’s Mayco member for transport and urban development. Purchase said the City intends to raise this matter with the NHDA once again so they can get clarity on whether the land is needed by the national government. But residents are fed up with the long wait and confusion. “While we’re sleeping, they’re selling our land, and I foresee the same problem carrying on for many years. Residents are becoming more despondent and angry about this,” said Murtadoh Abarder, a resident in Bo-Kaap. The Bo-Kaap Civic Association said the City’s social housing policy was “a screw-up”. “Our biggest push for Bo-Kaap is for housing to be made a priority,” said association chairperson Osmad Shabodien. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

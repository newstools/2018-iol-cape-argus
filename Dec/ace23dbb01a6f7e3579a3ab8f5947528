CEO of Agri Western Cape, Carl Opperman has shared his relief that agriculture’s water restrictions have been lifted to 10%. "This will help the sector a great deal with recovering from damages caused by the severe water shortages of the past months. If the restrictions remained at 60%, crops would not have been able to recover. Agri Western Cape is also grateful for the good relationship that was established between the City of Cape Town and the agriculture sector of the Western Cape over the past months," Carl Opperman said. He explained that both the COCT and the agriculture sector have been severely affected by the drought, and that constructive relationships are crucial in managing the challenges to the benefit of both the agriculture sector and residents of the metropole. "Agri Western Cape wants to thank Minister Nkwinti for understanding that water is critical for a sustainable agricultural sector and food security," Opperman said.

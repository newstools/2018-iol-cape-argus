This was revealed in a monitoring and evaluation report by the Western Cape Department of Social Development, released last month. Workers at the foundation have accused management of maladministration. “We are committed to good governance and ethical management, as evidenced by clean independent audits over the years. Our audited financial statements have always been, and continue to be, open to public scrutiny,” said Kevin Chaplin, managing director of the foundation.

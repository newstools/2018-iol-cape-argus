Cape Town - Members of social housing advocacy group Reclaim the City have illegally occupied a prime piece of land in Foreshore. Several shacks have also been erected on the land. "This used to be a public land that is now kept by the wealthiest company and this land symbolizes the problems that we are facing in Cape Town," said Reclaim the City's Nkosikhona Swaartbooi. Swaartbooi said they plan to occupy the land for the next few days. The occupation comes following reports that the City lost out on R140 million of public money due to an alleged botched auction of prime land on the Foreshore. Social housing advocacy group Ndifuna Ukwazi initially sounded the alarm after they obtained documents which raised serious questions about top City officials allegedly implicated in a so-called botched auction of the prime piece of land.      The City gave notice in local newspapers of an application by Growthpoint Properties Limited to develop Site B - a 3 932m2 piece of prime land on the Foreshore. "We are seeing land being sold to the private sector we are here to stop that because this is vital land that can be used to stop the housing crisis in our City," Swaartbooi said. Growthpoint properties have applied for an urgent court application that will be heard later today. "We became aware of people occupying the land in the early hours of the morning. We do understand that its members of Reclaim the City and members of Ndifuna Ukwazi. We do understand their concerns but what we don't understand is them occupying the land we currently use as a parking lot while we go through the development plans," said Tim Irzine Asset management for commercial properties of Growthpoint.      marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

Students from across the globe are flocking to UCT for the prestigious tournament, which begins today and ends on January 4. Panels will exchange views on global issues, following the four-team British Parliamentary format, with two teams representing the proposition and opposition. Tournament director Emma Tiffin said they were expecting more than 900 participants from 170 universities. “We have three categories, English as a foreign language, English as a second language and the open category,” Tiffin said. She said the aims were to foster international ties, promote cultural exchange and challenge some of the brightest minds in the world. The WUDC is one of the largest debate competition in the world, first held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1981. Joseph Mireku, spokesperson for the Speech Forces Organisation, said they were very grateful one of their team members would be speaking for the University of Ghana. Mireku said they aimed to improve dialogue and debate by helping young people develop critical-thinking tools.

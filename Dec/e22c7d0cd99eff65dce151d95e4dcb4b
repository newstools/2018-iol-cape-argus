Through a series of interventions, Child Safe SA has conducted a SafeTravelToSchool programme award ceremony to acknowledge drivers who consistently drive safely. Project manager Kay Jaffer said on Saturday that Child Safe SA celebrated the safest drivers of the year, giving awards to the two fastest drivers “and also celebrating Child Safe SA's fifth year of the programme”. Jaffer said the initiative aimed to develop safer, reliable, more road-safety-aware drivers, and confident learner transport drivers. The programme, which was launched in 2015, was primarily funded by Discovery Health and Discovery Insure, and currently had more than 800 participating drivers. Jaffer said the programme was launched with 17 drivers in Athlone. “Today we have over 800 drivers, driving 10000 kids to and from school.” She said that every three months Child Safe SA acknowledged the safest driver of the quarter with small cash and other prizes. “At the end of the year we acknowledge the safest driver of the year with substantial cash prizes and a new vehicle,” Jaffer added. She said that key to the programme was that participants had to install the Discovery DQ patented tracking device in each vehicle. The device monitored the driver’s driving behaviour and scored it. Jaffer said they received feedback from scores of drivers, and encouraged them to improve. “We also train them in first aid and defensive driving, test their eyesight and give them glasses if necessary, and check their wellness indicators, such as blood pressure.” Winners Felix Phahlane and None Jikwana each received a brand new Nissan seven-seater vehicle. Runners-up were Tsholosholo Khantsi, Anthea Smith and Sam Msadu. The most improved driver, Ridawaan Kamalie, received a cash prize. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

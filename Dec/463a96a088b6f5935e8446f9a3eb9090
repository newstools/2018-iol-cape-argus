Johannesburg - President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to announce the new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) on Tuesday. The announcement comes a few weeks after the panel appointed by Ramaphosa concluded interviewing 12 candidates for the top job. Four names were then forwarded to the president to make the final decision. Those who made the cut include: • Adv Shamila Batohi • Adv Siyabulela Mapoma • Adv Simphiwe Mlotshwa • Adv Rodney de Kock, and • Adv Andrea Johnson The presidency’s announcement on Monday means Ramaphosa is on track to meet the deadline which was set by the Constitutional Court for him to appoint a new NPA head by December 19 (90 days). This is after former NDPP Shaun Abraham’s appointment, by former president Jacob Zuma, was declared invalid by the apex court. The court ruled that the departure of former NDPP Mxolisi Nxasana, after he received a R17 million golden handshake, was illegal. Nxasana was ordered to pay back R10 million of the R17 million he received from the state after he vacated office. Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga said it would not remedy the law for Nxasana to return to office. The appointment of a new NPA head has lauded as a step in rebuilding a stronger NPA.

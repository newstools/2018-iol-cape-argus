According to spokesperson Craig Lambinon, the spring tide effect, which leads to higher than normal high tide and lower than normal low tides, has started taking effect and will lead towards the full moon peak at 3pm on Saturday. Lambinon warned fishers, bathers, beach walkers and coastal hikers to be cautious, especially during the afternoons at high tide when the tide peaks. “Some beaches will have very little place for beachgoers as the high tide rises. Rock anglers should be aware that places that they have fished from previously during the past week may be submerged at high tide. “Those hiking on the coastline should realise that their proposed route may not be accessible because of the higher than usual tide. “Sea Rescue is appealing to parents to make sure their children have responsible adult supervision when they’re around any water.” He said that because many people found rip currents hard to identify, he was urging the public to swim only at beaches where lifeguards were on duty. The ten city beaches given Blue flag status as part of the National Blue Flag Programme are Bikini, Mnandi, Strandfontein, Muizenberg, Fish Hoek, Llandudno, Camps Bay, Melkbosstrand, Silwerstroomstrand and Clifton Fourth beaches. They have been ranked for their cleanliness, adequate ablution facilities and parking, and they’re environmentally sound and safe. Senior weather forecaster Thabisile Ntleko said partly cloudy to clear skies with warm temperatures were expected for the weekend, with moderate winds becoming fresh in the afternoons. athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

Cape Town - The levels of the dams which supply Cape Town declined by 1% over the past week to 70,3 % of storage capacity. This is compared to dam levels of  35,3% at the same time last year. The average water consumption decreased by 13 million litres per day to 563 million litres per day for the past week, which is well within the usage range. The City encourages water users to continue to be water-wise and to build on the good conservation practices they adopted to beat the drought. This is in line with the thrust of Level 3 restrictions which came into effect on 1 December 2018. Water restrictions and the associated tariffs have been lowered from Level 5 to Level 3 recovery restrictions, which includes increasing the daily usage from 70 litres per person per day to 105 litres per person per day; or from 500 million litres to 650 million litres of collective usage per day. Tariffs have also been lowered to Level 3. If, for example, residents use less than 6 000 litres per month (Step 1) they can expect to pay 35,5% less. This decision follows on from the National Department of Water and Sanitation’s latest water assessment. Restrictions remain on a fairly strict recovery level as a precaution to deal with rainfall uncertainty in 2019 and 2020. The City encourages Cape Town’s water ambassadors to maintain their water-wise approach during the recovery phase and as the metro moves towards becoming a more water-sensitive city in the near future The 40% restriction on water usage applicable to businesses has been removed but the sector is strongly encouraged to continue implementing and investigating the further efficient use of water in their operations.

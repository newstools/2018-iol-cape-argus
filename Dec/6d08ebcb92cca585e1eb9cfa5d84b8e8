Thirteen arrests, for assault, possession of drugs and stolen property, theft and fraud, have been made since the unit’s deployment. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said apart from the arrests, the REU’s presence at stations and on trains had contributed to greater commuter compliance and discipline, ensuring order during crowd control and contributing to safer arrivals and departures of trains. Scott said on Tuesday last week, three cable thieves had each been sentenced in the Bishop Lavis Magistrate’s Court to eight years’ imprisonment. “This brings the total number of successful prosecutions in the Western Cape since March this year to 17,” she said. “Since the introduction of additional measures such as armed escorts, drone surveillance and armoured vehicle patrols, incidents of vandalism and cable theft have decreased significantly in area central,” Scott said. She said the efficacy of the interventions, in addition to the region’s forensic capability, was evident in the number of arrests and convictions since the beginning of 2018. The unit is a joint venture between the City and Metrorail and was officially deployed on trains, on October 13, by Transport Minister Blade Nzimande. Metro Rail regional manager Richard Walker said despite a significant reduction in the number of incidents involving signal cable theft and vandalism, a lot still had to be done. “We now demand that non-compliant scrap dealers be closed down, and lobby for legislation that permits only electronic payment methods for non-ferrous metal transactions.” Walker said he believed the current practice of “cash for copper, no questions asked” provided incentive for opportunists in both the legal and illicit scrap dealing industry. Walker thanked communities that continue to provide intelligence and complimented organisations lobbying for change. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

Cape Town - Christopher September and Larry Johnson have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 6-month-old Zahnia Woodward. September and Johnson were also found guilty of attempted murder, and the possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. Johnson and his mother, Miriam Johnson, 61, were found guilty of defeating the ends of justice in their attempt to get rid of his car, which was found abandoned an hour after the shooting in Masiphumelele. Miriam was handed a 5-year suspended sentence. On 30 December 2016, a bullet hit Zahnia in the head as men in a white VW Golf opened fire on her father Bradley Robyn, and five of his friends in Carnation Road, Ocean View. Zahnia had been sitting on Bradley’s lap, as the two waited for Cindy to come from work. On Monday, Zahnia's mom brought the courtroom to tears when she spoke of her pain after losing her only child in a drive-by shooting. “Six months may seem like a short time to you, but that was her entire life,” said Cindy Woodward, testifying in aggravation of sentencing against her daughter Zahnia’s two convicted killers. saafia.february@inl.co.za

The two had not seen each other for about a month following Rohde’s conviction for the murder of Kathryn’s mother and his wife, Susan. He was also found guilty of staging the murder as a suicide. Susan’s body was found on July 24, 2016, with an electronic cord wrapped around her neck, hanging from a hook behind the bathroom door of the room they shared at the Spier Wine Estate Hotel. There was a silence at the Cape High Court on Thursday, as Kathryn walked to the witness stand. She was followed by Rohde’s mother, Brenda Rohde. As Kathryn stood transfixed, Rohde was overwhelmed with emotions. He had moments where he stared at the ground for a long time before looking back at his daughter who maintained her composure despite her reluctance to testify in court. Defence advocate, Graham Van der Spuy, reminded the court of an order made in October 2017, at the start of the trial, in which Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe prohibited any photographs or video visuals of Rohde’s three daughter’s to be published or broadcast. However, Kathryn couldn’t give evidence due to time constraints. Sentencing proceeding are set to continue on February 18, 2019. Judge Salie-Hlophe has rejected yet another bail application made by the defence. Rohde will remain in custody. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus

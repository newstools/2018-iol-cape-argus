Eleven public open spaces have been selected for the discharge of fireworks, and law enforcement and neighbourhood watch groups will be deployed to the locations. “Children and animals are often the victims of fireworks-related injuries, and this year, I want to focus on reducing the number of injuries to these vulnerable groups. Pet owners should keep their pets indoors as far as possible as pets are left traumatised,” said mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith. He said fireworks needed to be kept to locations at Athlone Stadium parking area, Wesfleur sports field, Bishop Lavis sports field, Blue Downs sports field, Strandfontein Pavilion and the stretch of beach at the Table View beachfront tourism kiosk. Other locations include Delft Central sports grounds, Macassar Beach parking area, Swartklip sports complex, Sarepta sports complex and the Metropolitan sports grounds in Bonteheuwel. Allowing a child under 16 to handle fireworks without adult supervision leads to a R300 fine. athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

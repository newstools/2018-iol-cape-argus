“Supposedly it’s a planning problem; the ANC has not been in a position to be trusted to be planning in the public’s interest for the past seven years. The rampage and looting didn’t allow for forward-thinking. He added that the decision followed the state's planning system which was compromised by interest groups. “The last eight years were lost opportunity. Things will get worse. It takes a long time to build a nuclear plant,” Mathekga said. He further doubted that the governing party would be able to carry the country out of this energy crisis. Several attempts were made to get the ANC's comment on Mathekga's claims but to no avail. Eskom on Sunday implemented Stage 2 rotational load shedding from 8am to 10pm. “Due to the high unavailability of plant, Eskom was unable to build the necessary reserves, resulting in high probability of Stage 2 rotational load shedding from 10am on Sunday. Stage 2 required that 2000 megawatts of electricity is rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. Eskom said the load shedding was conducted rotationally as a last resort measure to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. The City of Cape Town encouraged residents to reduce their energy usage. Political parties such as the DA and Congress of the People (Cope) have blamed the ANC for the crisis. Tertius Simmers, DA provincial spokesperson on Economic Opportunities, Tourism and Agriculture, said: “This is the price that we and future generations will continue to pay thanks to the ANC and its systemic culture of cronyism and corruption which reached new heights in the complete seizure of our country, its resources and the services meant for our people.” Cope national spokesperson Dennis Bloem said: “The nation needs to know the true extent of the crisis facing Eskom and the impact that it may have on the country as a whole, as well as on our economy and future growth prospects.” zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus

This was a second attempt at voting for the nominees after an election process earlier this month was declared invalid. This was due to alleged corruption. Provincial ANC spokesperson Dennis Cruywagen did not offer up any names that made the lists. “Once the committee has sanctioned the two lists, it will present them to the national executive committee, which is scheduled to discuss, consolidate and finalise them at a meeting due to be held in Durban next month. Once the NEC has signed it off, it is up to them to make the list public. Names will probably come out (in public) over the next few weeks.” Voting for the nominees started last Wednesday and ran “into the early hours” on Sunday, said Cruywagen. “There were 32 ballot boxes where branch members voted. Everything was smooth. There were no hitches. “For candidates, who make the final election lists, getting elected into public office will depend on the ANC’s performance in the 2019 general election.” Names that have reportedly made the previous list included former Western Cape premier Ebrahim Rasool, who will run the party’s election campaign in the province. ANC veteran Cameron Dugmore and Youth League leader Khalid Sayed were also listed. yazeed.kamaldien@gmail.com Cape Argus

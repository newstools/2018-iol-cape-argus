Cape Town - Pick n Pay has donated R88 500 towards school supplies for children who were affected by the Khayelitsha fire in October. Customers who donated via till points and online to help those in need have raised more than R100 000. The company focused on the children who were most affected, because many at the time were preparing to write exams. Director of transformation for Pick n Pay, Suzanne Ackerman-Berman, said: “Over the past month, we have worked closely with 15 affected schools in the area and the Western Cape Education Department to assess the exact needs of the children deeply affected, and on Tuesday we handed over 177 gift cards to the value of R500 each, totalling R88 500. These will be used to replace school clothing, shoes and stationery that were devastated by the fire.” Each gift card included a leaflet that showed what clothing was available in-store so the children and parents knew what they could purchase. The principals took ownership of the gift cards and would ensure the 177 identified children would receive the clothing and supplies. In October, a massive fire affected 342 households in Khayelitsha and thousands of people were displaced. “It is devastating what these families and communities had to go through, and we are grateful we can play a part in helping the community rebuild. Schooling is so important and we hope this contribution can assist in elevating some of the stress of preparing for a new school year,” Ackerman-Berman said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

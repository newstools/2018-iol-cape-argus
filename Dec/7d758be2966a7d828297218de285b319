“If you pass my store, I want you to feel love,” said Shamiela van Niekerk from Mitchells Plain. Van Niekerk, 62, and her husband Ismaal Jappie, 67, woke up at 2am to start preparing their wares for the market and said they spend a lot of time decorating their stall to spread love and good cheer. “A lot of people thank me for making my store so beautiful and they want to be in the store. Things are hard out there but you must spend money to make it beautiful. A lot of people come here... people I don’t know, but I do it for them. “It takes me from 12pm till 5pm to set it up so that it looks like a little store. “You feel good when you walk into my store. I’ve been doing this for a good couple of years. I always come back, it’s a lovely market,” said Van Niekerk. Van Niekerk’s husband, grandchild and a friend help her at the clothing store to put food on their table and she said her earnings from previous markets helped her to put her adopted daughter through college. “If you don't work for yourself, nobody gives it to you. When I hear there is no market then I want to cry.” Mayco member for Area North Grant Twigg said the market, which had its last run for the year last night, has been great and the feedback from vendors may see the market continuing for a longer period in future. “It’s the third year we're running it. It was initially on and off in past years, until we started putting effort into it. “If the vendors say they want it to stay for longer, there is no reason for us to stop something good. “The City is always eager and keen to make things work and we can make it better and perhaps extend it,” said Twigg. athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

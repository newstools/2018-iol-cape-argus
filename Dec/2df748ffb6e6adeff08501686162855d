On Monday, Kolisi was joined by Western Province captain Chris van Zyl, Stormers hooker Scarra Ntubeni, comedian Siv Ngesi and big wave surfer Greg Bertish. Newborns Trust organised the celebration as a way of cheering up the mothers for the festive season. There are 63 babies in the ICU. Newborns Trust manager Amy MacIver said: “We thought it would be nice to come in and cheer up mothers before Christmas. “Christmas is a difficult time in the unit because the babies have to stay here up to three months and mothers have to go home, which means they won’t spend enough time with their baby during Christmas time” Kolisi said: “We are here to show the mothers we care and understand that it is difficult. They need to know they are loved and we care because every child deserves an opportunity.”      Springbok Captain Siya Kolisi, along with Scarra Ntubeni, Siv Ngesi and Greg Bertish spread some Christmas cheer at Groote Schuur Hospital's maternity ward.Video: @sukainaish @IOL pic.twitter.com/GUWp0Ti2E2 The NSRI donated soap and body lotion, a pharmaceutical company donated purple bags and church groups donated baby clothes. Newborns Trust also received a R2000 cake donation, which was shared among the parents and nurses. MacIver said one in seven babies were premature and it was hoped that this initiative would create awareness. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus

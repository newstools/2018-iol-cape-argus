Pre-trial proceedings for Tafelsig pastor Keith Bird are under way. He is facing two murder charges, four rape charges, a theft charge and four crimen injuria charges. The murder charge is linked to an incident in January 2013, when it is alleged that the pastor killed his ex-fiancée, An-Niesa Bardien, 37, by strangling her in bushes in Strandfontein and crushing her head with a rock. Bardien’s decomposed body was found three months later, in a shallow grave, at Strandfontein beach. His alleged second victim, Sharvonne Koense, who was murdered five months after Bardien, was also found strangled, in Tafelsig. Koense had been raped. According to court papers, Bird had sex with a colleague who worked with him at a cleaning company. He recorded the act without the woman’s knowledge then showed the footage to four people at work. He is charged with crimen injuria for recording the footage without consent and three additional crimen injuria charges for showing it to three people. It was reported that Bird allegedly lured his victims under the pretence of a job offer. One of his victims, who was sexually assaulted multiple times, he met on Mxit. Two of the rape incidents occurred in January 2014, another a month later, and the fourth in May 2014. Bird was arrested in June last year and is in custody. He will appear next year, on March 4. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus

They attended the debating camp on December 10 and 11 in Borneo, Malaysia The Borneo debate camp gives advanced debate training and is organised by the Malaysia Institute of Debate and Public Speaking. The eight learners from the Western Cape and Lesotho participated in the camp alongside other Asian and Malaysian pupils. The pupils were trained on how to debate on various international topics such as war, nuclear bomb manufacturing, hate speech, climate change, African migration to Western countries, etc. Pupils Siyakholwa Ngcobo, Abongile Naketsana, Sinethemba Narwele and Ntyantyambo Funda were invited to the convention because they were the winners of debates in junior and senior level categories at the African Future Leaders Hub Speaking Convention in October at the Castle of Good Hope. “Learners were grouped in four classes, even our Cape Town learners were split. They were grouped after a first induction session, after which they were assessed on speakers' roles, style and experience, but in the final sessions they were put together,” said Africa Future Leaders Hub founder Denilson Ralekoala. Apart from the educational activities, the learners were also able to explore the city of Kuching. “As a coach I can say the pupils who attended this training will never be the same, from possessing passports for the first time, to being in different aircraft and different cities,” said Ralekoala. “The experience was amazing. It’s one that made me grow not only as a speaker but as an individual. It advanced my reasoning skills in a way that they didn’t just teach us debating techniques but they enlightened us on real-life content,” said Abongile Maketsana from Fezeka High School. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus

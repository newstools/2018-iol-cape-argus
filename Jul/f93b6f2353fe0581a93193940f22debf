Eight people, on their way to look for firewood, were on the trailer when it was swept away by a strong current. Only two managed to swim to safety. Police divers have recovered the bodies of three people, and the search continues for the other three. The bodies found were those of Ashley van Rooyen, 5, Patrick Simon, 27, and Marronique, 5. Yesterday, a police diving team scoured Jan du Toit’s River, a few kilometres outside Worcester, in search of the missing three. A devastated and heartbroken Lettie van Rooyen lost three relatives in the tragedy. “I can’t sleep at night because of what happened, and it will take time for me to recover from what has happened,” she said. Her family lives in a dilapidated house, which has no furniture. The house is surrounded by other old homes. Louis Ernest, a farmworker who was sent by Henti Huisamen, a farm owner, to look for the tractor and trailer on Sunday, said: “I saw the tractor on the riverside and noted the survivors, two boys, Jaun van Rooyen and Brandon Jack, clinging to a tree. “I took the boys and discovered that no one else was there. I told (the farm owner) and he alerted the emergency services.” Trauma counsellors from Worcester provided counselling to the relatives of the missing three people and the three people who drowned, while staff at the Thuthuzela care centre brought food and toiletries to the affected families. Staff from the Afrikaanse Christelike Vroue Vereniging donated blankets and clothing. Huisamen said he, too, was devastated. “This is very traumatising, and unbearable. It was an accident. Nobody intended this to happen. I send my condolences to them,” he said. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

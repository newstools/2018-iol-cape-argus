The 68-year-old is the uncle to Springbok and Stormers rugby player, Eben Etzebeth. His son, Clifford, said he is not sure of the details of the accident, but that his father lived a full life. He said his family is still trying to come to terms with his death. Etzebeth was a legend in the Goodwood, Epping (now Ruyterwacht) area, as much for his bar-brawling antics with his brother Skattie, as for his wrestling prowess. In 2012, at age 62, he won the world title in the veterans division in Albania. He also played rugby for Goodwood and Villagers. He leaves behind his widow, three daughters and one son as well as his mother, who is in her nineties. Condolences for Clifford's passing has also been shared on social media:        @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The programme will provide Haafith schools, which teach the memorisation of the Holy Qur'an, with education that incorporates both an Islamic and CAPS academic programme. The MJC’s education head Shaykh Riad Fataar, said they were happy that it would be a well-balanced education system. Ultimately, pupils will easily reintegrate into the school system. He explained that the classes would take place on Saturdays at schools. Fataar said: “The classes are taught by retired educators who dedicate their time to teach the required subjects - making learners eligible to return to the school environment in the appropriate grade. "The programme also requires parents to complete a special home-schooling form. This will ensure learners remain registered. "The MJC will also assist Haafith schools in the curriculum, with the upskilling of educators, administrative functions and infrastructure requirements as per municipal by-laws. "Compliant Haafith schools are issued with a compliance certificate valid for one year. This groundbreaking project is a first for South Africa and comes at no cost to the Haafith schools, parents and learners.” Haafith schools that received compliance certificates: are the Al Furqaan Hifth School, Madrasatu Nur Hifth School, Tayyibah Al Nashr Institute, Darul Qur’aan Institute, Dairatul Ilm Haafith School, Markaz Iqraa il Quraan, Al Tartil Hifth Institute, Crescent Hifth School, Zain bin Thabiet Ghaafieth Academy, Dar al-Shifaa’ Haafith School, Dar al-Tarbiyah Quraan Institute, Ibn Al-Jazary Institute, Jam’eyyatul Qurra Male and Female Hifth Institute and Madrasa Ahlil Quraan Male and Female Haafith School. @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus

Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says polls are not a real reflection of the situation. “Yes there might be anger at the DA because of the handling of the DA’s internal problems like with Patricia de Lille and issues of transformation. That anger won’t get the ANC a vote,” he said. In its latest Pulse of the People study, Ipsos said out of 3000 randomly selected South Africans, 60% supported the ANC nationally. The DA and EFF came second (13%) and EFF (7%) third. The survey found the ANC and the DA were neck and neck in the Western Cape, where they polled 26% and 28% respectively. “At the end of the Zuma years, trust in the ANC was very low, but the party has recovered quite significantly in the last seven months. The trust indices for both the DA and the EFF are in negative terrain, but the EFF made more progress in terms of building trust than the DA. “These are the views of the whole of the South African electorate, but it is also important to look to which degree the supporters of a party express their trust in the party,” Ipsos said. Mathekga however said there was enough time for the DA to regain support and to even gain more. “Gauteng is a hotspot and one cannot think that the ANC will be there to take it outrightly. One has to do this poll in the next three months to see how credible it is,” he said. Professor Amanda Gouws, a political analyst at Stellenbosch University, said the DA’s internal issues had caused a loss in support. “The drop in support for the DA is a result of the bad handling of the De Lille matter, the water crisis and the fact that Mmusi Maimane is not doing enough to put the black voters at ease on the party’s position on transformation,” she said. Gouws also said many South Africans - soured by Jacob Zuma’s leadership - were returning to the ANC. “There are many South Africans returning to the party because of the Cyril Ramaphosa effect.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

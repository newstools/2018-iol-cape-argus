Steenvilla evictee 55-year-old Beverley Cupido is devastated by how her belongings are getting damaged by the constant wind and rain. “I do not know how am I supposed to feel now this saddened and devastated me,” she said. “Why can’t we get the land that we want?” Residents hoped to rely on the City’s Disaster Risk Management centre for assistance, but according to spokesperson Charlotte Powell, this service specifically handles flooding in public areas. “Various roads across the City have been affected by heavy downpours. No evacuation or emergency shelter has been required.” said Powell. “The informal Settlements Department is making assessments and providing residents in informal settlements with flood kits. Mayco member Brett Herron said Cape Town was experiencing the much awaited and needed rain. “Flooding has occurred due to the water being prevented from entering the gully (in roads), which is the entry point into the stormwater system, as a result of obstructions at the mouth of the catch pit or gully,” he said. “This could be caused by loose debris on the road surface that had landed in the opening of the gully, causing a blockage.” The City warned residents after the SA Weather Service predicted heavy rainfall and high winds in Cape Town this week. For flooding and emergencies, dial 107 on landlines or 0214807700 on cellphones. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

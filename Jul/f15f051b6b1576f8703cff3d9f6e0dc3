With no comments received on its annual budget and municipal tariff increases for 2019/2020 financial year, the municipality went ahead with the increases. Colin Puren, spokesperson for the Mossel Bay Municipality, said it had hoped a private entrepreneur would build a crematorium at the new cemetery. “We hoped there would be a crematorium, given the drastic increases of grave site costs from July 1. “These had to increase substantially to cover the capital costs to develop the grave sites. The increased costs are a representation of the actual costs the municipality has to cough up to make the grave sites available,” he said. Puren said the increases took effect from July 1. “These costs refer to grave sites that were pre-booked and paid for. “As with all tariffs, grave site tariffs are adjusted every year,” he said. But Puren said for indigent consumers, there was only a marginal increase. “The grave- site cost for one person who is a registered indigent customer goes up to R249. It previously cost R237. “The 2018/19 budget was for several months open for public participation at libraries and the municipal offices, but the municipality received no comments, and soon thereafter it was accepted by the council,” he said. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

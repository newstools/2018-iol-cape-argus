The Usasazo High School matriculant took his first flight abroad to compete on the international stage where hundreds of participants came together for the skipping competition from July 1 to 11. Tumtumana managed to take 11th spot in the 30-second double under mixed pairs skipping division, which was done with a partner, as well as 20th place in the 30- second speed category with 152 skips. Tumtumana also came 10th in the three minutes speed sector with 866 skips, making his team coach and national programme manager Keo Mokolopo proud. “Malusi remained in great spirits on day one, and on day three he competed in freestyle, placing 23rd and ending his competition with a big smile,” said Ukuphumelela Trust spokesperson Anne Vermaak. “He then had the opportunity to visit Disney World on a sight-seeing day, a dream come true. “The final day he spent in a training camp with other skippers and coaches, all learning from each other, and now he’s able to bring that knowledge home for his team at Jump It Rope Skipping Academy.” Vermaak said Tumtumana brought the skills he had learnt, as well as a bag of donated shoes from Bermuda Skipping, back to his team, which will assist the high-level skippers at the Jump It Rope Skipping Academy to reach new heights. Tumtumana said he never thought skipping would become more than a pastime, but was now more motivated to improve his skill and make his mark internationally. “In 2005 I started skipping. I never thought it was being more than a hobby because I thought skipping was for girls. “My first national competition was in 2009 in Gauteng and I won an award and decided to work at it. It’s been the best thing!” @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

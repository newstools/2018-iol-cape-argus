On Monday, Grant’s spokesperson, Siphesihle Dube, said the report was not yet complete. He said neither Grant nor the ministry had received the assessors’ report. “However, a progress report has been received from the registrar of the Provincial Regulatory Entity. “This progress report clearly indicates that the independent assessors have requested an extension of time in order to allow for additional evidence to be gathered and additional parties to be interviewed,” he said. Dube said the full and proper completion of the progress report was important to ensure the independence and unbiased nature of the report. Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association chairperson Victor Wiwi said they were still awaiting an announcement as to when the report would be released. “We heard that it was coming out, but then the MEC pulled it back. We don’t know what’s going on with it now,” said Wiwi. The provincial ANC seems to believe the report was delayed in order to allow Grant to tweak it. “As the ANC, we read this statement to mean the report, which was prepared by two advocates, does not fit the MEC’s preconceived conclusions and recommendations,” said the party’s provincial secretary, Faiez Jacobs. “For the MEC to effectively seek to rewrite the report defeats the purpose of it being independent “The already completed report on taxi violence, which is long overdue for release, will take even longer to be released because the MEC wants it to be balanced,” said Jacobs. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

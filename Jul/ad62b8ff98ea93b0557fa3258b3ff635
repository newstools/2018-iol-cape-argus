Disaster Risk management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said these operation are ongoing. “The City has started our clean-up operations. Over 4000 structures were affected. The City’s informal settlements department has already started assessing the areas and delivered kits for residents to rebuild their structures.” She said the City is focusing on informal settlements such as Macassar, Khayelitsha and Philippi. “The Transport and Urban Development Department has also started working on the flooded roads and doing road works,” she said. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said: “The City received numerous complaints yesterday afternoon. We’ve also been in Khayelitsha to asses the structures there to see what can be saved and what can’t, keeping in mind that some of these structures were built on wetlands making them difficult to be repaired.” Today, 3 July, Smith will be launching the City’s Safe Space for street people. The pilot project is a first for Cape Town and aims to provide overnight shelter for up to 230 street people at a facility underneath the Culemborg bridge on the Foreshore. This facility will serve as a transitional shelter option as existing shelters are overpopulated in the CBD and surrounds. “This is something I wanted to do for five years. I am very proud of the Safe Place. We had to deal with a lot of complicated issues but managed,” he said. The centre contains basic services such as ablutions, water and storage lockers. The Safe Space will provide access to social and health services. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

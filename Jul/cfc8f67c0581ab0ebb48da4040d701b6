The trio were among six people who disappeared after the tractor trailer transporting them plunged into a river on Sunday, according to police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexane. The bodies of three people, a 30-year-old man and two children, were recovered the on Monday, she said on Tuesday. Breede Valley Local Municipality community and services director Jonathan Marthinus said: “Eight people tried to cross the river while there was strong flooding. These eight people were trying to collect firewood across the bridge, using the tractor as their transport.” Marthinus said only two of the eight managed to swim to safety. The municipality’s spokesperson Johann Botha said the NSRI and community members joined in the search. “We are saddened, as the Breede Valley Local Municipality, to receive this sad news. This was probably caused by the heavy rains over the past two days,” said Botha. “We live on farms, which forces our people to use firewood to warm themselves, especially now that the Cape is experiencing a cold front,” he said. The municipality said the eight people were not related. It urged people not to attempt to cross flooded rivers. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

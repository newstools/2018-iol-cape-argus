Both Ruiters, 30, and Peters, 26, were served with high court indictments. This is after a year-long bail application at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court, where Ruiters was released on R2000 bail while her partner was denied bail. According to the indictment, Ruiters is charged with child abuse, under the Children’s Act, of Jeremiah and her two daughters, aged 8 and 3. The State sought penalties which include a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment. If she is found guilty of more than one child abuse charge, the court papers said she would be “liable to a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 20 years or to both a fine and such imprisonment”. Meanwhile, Peters faces an additional charge of rape and murder compared to his girlfriend. For the rape charge the State submitted: ”When committed in circumstances where the victim is a person under the age of 16 years, a minimum sentence of life imprisonment is thus applicable.” For the murder charge Peters could get up to life imprisonment. It is the State’s case that Peters raped, beat and stabbed the toddler to death at their house in Kensington in June last year. Jeremiah is one of the more than 66 children murdered in the province over the past 18 months. On Mandela Day, advocacy groups launched a People’s Commission of Inquiry into child safety in the province. About 70 children, aged 14 to 17, have shared testimonies, through skilled facilitators, of their experiences with trauma and neglect. For the rest of the month, the organisation will be collecting children’s testimonies, and the children will formulate a Children’s Safety Charter to be sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

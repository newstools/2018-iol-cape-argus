The group were not expecting to win any categories, but managed to clinch second place in the Afrikaans sector and third spot in the singing of the AU anthem. Grade 11 pupil Elrique Davids also scooped up fourth place in the opera open sector for his baritone performance. Choir teacher Benita Koopman said she was ecstatic with the group's performance, which they excelled at despite facing setbacks. “I didn't expect anything because a quarter of the choir is new and also they start from Grade 8 when normally choirs have more mature voices in Grade 11 or so. The kids were also not always able to make practices because of circumstances. “They just went to do their best. The kids are quite elated. It was a good experience for them and they got to go on the Gautrain. The funds won will be put away for the choir.” "The pupils won R7 500 for attaining second place in the Afrikaans division and R5 000 for third place in the AU anthem." Koopman said the funds will be used on choir equipment and essentials as many members are missing basics such as blazers, which some of them borrow.

Cape Town - Left in the hands of children, complex adult problems appear to dissolve into simple solutions, as displayed by young entrepreneur "Hugo". Hugo is just 6 years old, and along with his "business partner", 7-year-old Silas, decided to set up shop in a village market, selling second-hand toys to supplement their income of R30 a week in pocket money, 10X reports. "On the day in question the two boys had a clear strategy, a focused plan and a specific goal, which they achieved by the end of the day. 10X is reliably told that this pattern of clear, systematic progress towards a goal is not unusual behaviour for Hugo," the investment company said. “Hugo has always been a saver. He gets R30 a week as pocket money. He always puts R20 of that into his savings and spends the rest at the tuckshop.” This is a clear example of paying yourself first, which is what the experts advise. Warren Buffet famously said: “Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.” Hugo had sufferedhis share of setbacks - his piggybank had been raided twice, prompting him to make another wise saving decision: moving his piggybank from his bedroom to a secure location in the family safe. "Now that it is out of sight it is also, as the saying goes, out of mind," 10X said. "These days when Hugo wants to make an acquisition (or even just blow some cash) he pauses and thinks about it rather than just dipping into his funds." Hugo hopes to purchase a drone, so he needed to supplement his revenue stream, prompting the young entrepreneur to diversify. Having conducted their market research, the two boys discovered they could host a stall at the village market at a cost of R10, and decided to prepare for the market day by refurbishing their toys for resale. It was a slow start to the day, and the boys soon realised their location, tucked away far from anchor tenants and high turnover stalls in the market, was impacting trade. They adapted their marketing strategy by going in search of potential customers on a one-on-one basis with specific products. An hour before closing time, they had sold 60% of their stock. A final marketing push significantly improved their sales. So, what lessons can be learnt from the two young entrepreneurs? * Pay yourself first – put money in your savings account before paying the tuckshop lady.
* Keep your money somewhere safe. Money that is harder to access, such as in a safe or in a savings fund or policy, is less likely to be spent on impulse purchases.
* Always have a savings goal in mind. Remind yourself why you’re doing this.
* All the clutter around you used to be money – and can be money again. Look after your possessions so you can resell them later.
* There is often a better way to do things. If something isn’t working try something else.
* It’s never too soon or too late to change your circumstances. Hugo and Silas made one final push in the last hour of their trading and it paid off. Many people approaching retirement can learn from this. Cape Argus

Metrorail Western Cape spokesperson Riana Scott had put the value of a fire-damaged carriage at between R1.5m and R6m. She added that the trend of setting trains alight was unheard of five years ago. Just on Saturday, three carriages were destroyed in another attack at Cape Town station. Scott said that Metrorail Protections Service, SAPS and a forensic team would be conducting their respective investigations as well.      Capetonians have been very active on social media voicing their discontent with the recent spate of attacks that have been taking place:                                                        @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

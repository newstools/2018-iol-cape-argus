The artwork, created at the Castle of Good Hope, will form part of the Nelson Mandela centennial celebrations. This year RIM will commemorate Mandela’s birth with a series of activities dedicated to his towering legacy. RIM spokesperson Morongoa Ramaboa said the painting would be unveiled soon. The children participated in boxing and skipping - both sports Mandela enjoyed. They were also told the story of Krotoa, a Khoi translator who was banished to Robben Island, where she died, and was later buried at the castle. Ramaboa said: “Nelson Mandela is quoted as saying: ‘We understand and promote the notion that while children need to be guided, they also have an entrenched right to be whatever they want to be and that they can achieve this only if they are given the space to dream and live out their dreams.’” This is why they hosted 100 children from local communities at the Castle of Good Hope to celebrate the spirit of Madiba. “By reaching out to children from communities who may have never visited the Robben Island Museum, we are hoping to continue the work of Nelson Mandela by creating a fun and active space for children to learn and love the amazing heritage we share as South Africans,” Ramaboa said. @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus

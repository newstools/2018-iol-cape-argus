Mbombo and Engelbrecht introduced two patients who had life-changing operations. Among those patients who received an operation is 2-year-old Zharane Lewin from Grassy Park. Lewin had a tonsillectomy (tonsil removal) at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital after enlarged tonsils affected her quality of life. Robert Francis from Mitchells Plain, who suffered from arthritis in his hip for the past five years, will be celebrating his 57th birthday on Mandela Day after successfully undergoing hip surgery. Almost 200 patients will be receiving surgery. This year, the provincial department’s initiative will be improving the health of 100 people who are in dire need of life-changing operations. The initiative, which was started last year in partnership with Independent Media, has already embarked on a series of life-changing surgeries such as knee replacement, cataract operations, ear, nose and throat procedures and female sterilisation. Eight hospitals, including Groote Schuur, Paarl, Worcester, Mitchells Plain and the New Somerset Hospital will perform hip and knee surgeries. The Red Cross Children’s Hospital will perform 28 ear, nose and throat procedures, while Mitchells Plain District Hospital will perform about 40 sterilisation procedures. This is the second year running “We are privileged as a department to be giving back to the community through this initiative. It warms my heart to see how people’s lives have changed by these surgeries. We have been able, with the help of our private partners to add value to the lives of many patients. We have proven that by working together, we can achieve our goal and even more,” Mbombo said. Engelbrecht said the department had noted the increase of acute load due to trauma, with elective surgeries such as hip and knee replacements increasing in recent years. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

It’s emerged that the Cape Peninsula University of Technology signed an agreement with H&H Sourcing Trading represented by Andre Mostert Vervoer to use the area to tip soil on the site which could potentially affect the developments. The Cape Argus is in possession of the agreement that the university signed with the company. The executive director of Infrastructure Development and Facilities, Sibusisiwe Sibanda, gave permission to the company, the agreement states: “Andre Mostert will solely be permitted to tip on the site as of May 3, 2018. As agreed on Andre Mostert Vervoer will ensure the maintenance of the area.” Nellis Kruger from the Zonnebloem Neighbourhood Watch said: “The main concern is regarding the soil tipping. “I live in the area and you can see that massive heap of soil.” Kruger said that no one from the area was consulted about this and it was cause for concern. “This affects the residents who are waiting to return to their land,” he said. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley did confirm that a contractor was given the right to fill a ditch located on the District Six campus earlier this year. "The land had recently become unlawfully occupied and the Executive Director of Infrastructure and Facilities management at the time believed that it would be in the institutions interest to take advantage of the opportunity to fill the hole and provide a presence on that spot. "When objections were raised work on the site stopped and the institution is currently engaging with a number of stakeholders to resolve the matter," she said. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

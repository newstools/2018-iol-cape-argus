In an attempt to arrest the social ills among youth, community worker Ellis Fortuin, relied on an almost forgotten culture as a solution. Fortuin started a dance group two years ago. Rieldans is an ancient dance form, practised by the Khoi, San and Nama peoples. She said it was her way of keeping children off the street. “I am very proud of them too. They are young and have taken naturally to the dance. And it is an interracial group. The group of children are from all races and they love to dance.” Wesbank has a 95% coloured population and Fortuin wanted to teach them the history of the dance. “It is also important for them to know their heritage and be proud of it. I explained to them what the 'rieldans' is about and they should be proud of it. I started the project because dancing is close to my heart. This is the dance our ancestors used to do. I want to keep it alive for our children,” she explained. The children almost took naturally to the dance form and their hard work was rewarded when they won a competition. The ATKV-Rieldans competition is an annual contest celebrating the dance and culture and bringing together groups from all over the Western and Northern Cape. The dancers from Wesbank won one of the categories the first time they entered. And to add the excitement, 10-year-old Meirill le Roux won the under-14 category. “Rieldans is very nice and we enjoy dancing. When taking part in competitions we also go to other places like Saldanha Bay where we also danced. It is nice to get out of Wesbank,” Meirill said. @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus

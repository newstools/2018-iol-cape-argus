“The residents are furious and they will be erecting new shacks,” resident Shahied Robain said. On Thursday, law enforcement dismantled the residents shacks. Those residents are without any shelter. The protesters, who call themselves Bo-Kaap Disadvantaged Community, are fourth and fifth-generation Bo-Kaap residents who now occupy congested homes with parents, children and grandchildren living under one roof. Many residents have been on the housing waiting list for up to 20 years and share a room with four other family members in a house occupied by three or more families. “We are demanding that they give us land, it’s as simple as that, the ward councillor is not listening to us,” Robain said. Last week, the residents and law enforcement were involved in a scuffle. Some were pepper sprayed while others were swearing at police officers. Ward 77 councillor Brandon Golding said: “I did meet with those residents in the week and I did tell them that plans are in place to unlock land. However, if they are going to invade land, the city’s law enforcement will demolish it.” Golding said he was engaging with the Bo-Kaap Civic Organisation and an elected housing group about having social housing possibly developed on appropriate land between Bo-Kaap and Tamboerskloof. Bo-Kaap residents have for several weeks taken to the streets to protest against tourists and further development in their area. @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

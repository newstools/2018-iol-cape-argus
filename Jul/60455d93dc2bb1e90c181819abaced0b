It's not something you'll see every day on a porn set - one person gets down on bended knee and declares their undying love for their partner with a giant sparkler. But Brian Bonds and Mason Lear made it official immediately after filming a gang bang scene together. Romantic, isn't it? (cough, cough) According to Pink News, Bonds popped the question straight after the pair stopped filming.      “Well, this is the end of our tour and I can say that this was probably the best day that ever happened between us. And I’d love to do it over and over again, but there is one difference that I want,” an excited Bonds exclaimed in a video posted to Twitter. And then he pulls out a box and says: “I want you wearing this.” Lear immediately says yes, and the pair kiss as the others cheer in the background. A match made in gay porn heaven, wouldn't you say?

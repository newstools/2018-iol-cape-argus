CAPE TOWN - South African men are being threatened by blackmailers on WhatsApp according to a new report. Rapport newspaper said on Monday that the criminals are attacking the victims by stating that they will share nude photos of them online unless they pay up. Multiple men have fallen victim to the scam over the last three months. The scam, which is conducted via WhatsApp, goes as follows:    If the victim refuses to send naked pictures, the scammer will resort to Photoshop to create images depicting the male as if he were naked. Private investigator Mike Bolhuis told Rapport that he has handled over 30 cases of blackmail using this tactic this year alone. Bolhuis said the initial blackmail amounts start at between R500 and R1,500 and some of his clients have paid over R50,000 to avoid humiliation and shaming. He said that in most cases the blackmailers are men who use a female photo. Bolhuis said he is not aware of a case where a woman has fallen for this scam.

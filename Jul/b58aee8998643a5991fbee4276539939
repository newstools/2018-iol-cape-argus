Police Minister Bheki Cele and national Commissioner General Khehla Sitole plan to return to Zwelihle today for a community engagement session. Cele’s visit comes after tensions between police officers and protesters increased rapidly, leading to the assault of a police official, who was hit with an axe and disarmed. Cele requested a private meeting with Hermanus Renewal leaders and some Hermanus residents and asked them to list their grievances to be attended to today when he makes a second visit. Some residents are still confused whether to go to work or remain in their homes. Three schools in Zwelihle, Lukhanyo Primary School, Zwelihle Primary school and Qhayiya Secondary School, remained closed. Resident Lungani Mbinza said: “Some of us, like me, I am confused whether to go to work or not. I ended up sitting at home.” The confusion came after voice notes and threatening WhatsApp messages stating that if anyone was caught going to work, their house will be burnt. Another Zwelihle Renewal leader Theron Mqhu appeared in the Hermanus Magistrate’s Court on charges of robbery, attempted murder and public violence, while another 11 residents appeared on charges of public violence. The case has been postponed to July 30. The remaining Zwelihle Renewal leaders’ phones are switched off. The Hermanus Community Policing Forum said on Facebook: “Police officials are aware of the many threatening messages going around but are not picking up physical evidence of these fear mongering tactics on the ground. SAPS is maintaining a high visibility.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

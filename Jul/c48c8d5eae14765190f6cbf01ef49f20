The dance crews, who took a leap of faith entering the competition, took the highest accolades by qualifying to take part in the world championship in November in Serbia. Bona Fide dance coach, Johnina Theron said The Vision dance group was only created earlier this year and walked away as gold medallists with the highest score overall. The Lil Poppers were close on their heels and scooped gold and the second highest score overall. Both groups qualify to represent South Africa in Serbia. Theron said the girls are excited to represent South Africa abroad, however, for the crews to go, they need to raise as much funds as possible, as each child needs R34 000 to participate in the competition. “I believe that with the help of the community we can help our dancers reach their dreams. This is an opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime and these girls really work hard for it. “Bona Fide dance studio is hosting a fund-raiser neon matinee and (we) invite everyone to support them, please. All children between the age of 10 and 16 are welcome to come and join in the fun,” said Theron. Theron said the fund-raiser will see a showcase of different hip-hop artists from different dance studios performing, as well as a DJ from metronome who will entertain guests. Neon merchandise will be on sale as well as snacks and boerewors rolls. It will cost R50 to get you in the door and parents are welcome to join the fun.

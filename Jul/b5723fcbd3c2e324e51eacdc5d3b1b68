CPUT council chairperson Nogolide Nojozi said Nhlapo’s appointment was unanimously endorsed at the senate and by the university’s council. Nhlapo’s appointment is on a five-year fixed term contract. He has been in an acting position since August last year. “As acting vice-chancellor Dr Nhlapo did an excellent job stabilising campuses and ensuring the continuation of the academic programme under very trying conditions in 2017. “Council unanimously supported DrNhlapo’s appointment and looks forward to working with him to implement the CPUT Vision 2030. I also call on all university stakeholders to give Nhlapo the necessary support during his tenure as vice-chancellor,” said Nojozi. Nhlapo previously held the position of the first ever deputy vice-chancellor: Research, Technology Innovation and Partnerships at CPUT. During that tenure he authored the Research, Technology and Innovation Blueprint for the institution that underpins the university’s Vision 2020. He has held a number of senior positions at higher education institutions and science councils, including head of chemistry at the Universities of the North and the Free State, before joining the National Research Foundation. About his appointment, he said: “I am thrilled and humbled to be appointed as the third vice-chancellor of CPUT. The task I face is complex. During my acting period I started with the conceptual underpinning of Vision 2030 for the institution. “I am looking forward to completing this plan and rolling it out to enable the institution to respond to challenges such as the fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, sustainable development and South Africa’s National Development Plan.” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

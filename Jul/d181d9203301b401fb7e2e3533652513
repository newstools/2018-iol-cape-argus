On Tuesday the teenager made his second appearance. The case was postponed to August 28 for representation to senior State prosecutor. The teen’s lawyer, Igshaan Higgins, said: “The minor is charged with public violence. The State has no grounds to pursue the case. We are hoping that it will withdraw the charges.” The teen, who was arrested over a month ago, was released on warning under his parents care. Bo-Kaap Youth spokesperson, Safwaan Laubscher, said the community stood by the teen. “He was arrested while we as a community were staging one of our awareness/protest gatherings in Wale Street. “We definitely feel it was unjust and the initial reasons for the arrest were quite vague. We as a community will continue to show and offer our support to the youth and family in any manner possible,” said Laubscher. In May, Bo-Kaap residents participated in a week-long protest expressing their objections to the gentrification of the area and the increase in the cost of municipal tariffs. The residents were calling for the Bo-Kaap area to be declared a World Heritage Site to prevent further developments. The most recent sale through a public auction by the property management department in the Bo-Kaap was conducted in June 2016 for Erf 142717 that was 140m² in extent. The zoning is single residential and the price was market-related. The purchaser was a Ms Goliath from the Bo-Kaap. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

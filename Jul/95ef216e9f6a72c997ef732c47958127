“We are talking about mid-year population estimates which use the latest fertility, mortality and migration data to estimate the size of the population. “Now, the mid-year estimates for 2018, we are sitting at 57.73 million people living in South Africa,” said Statistician-General of South Africa Risenga Maluleke at a media briefing in Pretoria. “In 2017 we were sitting at 56.8 million. We had 1.2 million births, a 0.2 net migration and we had about half a million deaths,” he said. About 51% (about 29.5 million) of the people in South Africa are female. A total of 29.5% of the population is aged younger than 15 years and 8.5% of the population (4.89 million) is 60 years or older. Life expectancy at birth for 2018 is estimated at 61.1 years for males and 67.3 years for females. Maluleke said the population estimates cover all residents in South Africa at the 2018 mid-year, and “are based on the latest available information”. African News Agency (ANA)

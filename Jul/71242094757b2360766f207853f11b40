Oscar Jasman went to visit his mother Adelaide Plato’s grave last week and made the horrifying discovery. “It was vandalised during the week of July 15 to 22. The vases were stolen, including the flowers placed inside. This is disgraceful as we unveiled the gravestone on May 12, at a cost of R12500.” “I feel disgusted and very saddened to think anyone would purposely damage someone’s grave. Vandals need to realise that while they might be having fun vandalising graves for money, it is us, the families of our beloved ones who are buried there, who are left hurting.” “We have noticed a few times before that there are guys walking around with spades, offering to assist to clean up around the grave. If you refuse they get upset and become abusive,” said Jasman Flowers were missing and ornaments were broken at a number of the gravesites in Klip Cemetery, with some of the gravestones broken and stolen. The foreman of Klip Cemetery, Francis Cloete, showed how the metal fencing was removed and some of the graves were badly vandalised. “The security officers on the site are only there to safeguard the office, not the graves. Whenever there is a funeral, these criminals sit outside the fence, waiting for the families to vacate the area, and then they come and take what they want on this gravesite,” said Cloete.   Eddie Andrews, City mayco member for Area South, which includes Ottery, said: “Cemeteries are difficult to secure as they are properties which are easily accessible. It is challenging to mitigate against crime and vandalism, which often takes place after hours. This is a growing problem in cemeteries across the country, and Cape Town is facing similar challenges. “Due to financial constraints, the City cannot afford to provide security guards to deliver 100% security coverage to cemeteries for each grave. Based on the City’s by-laws, the family of the deceased are responsible for the maintenance of the grave itself.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Town

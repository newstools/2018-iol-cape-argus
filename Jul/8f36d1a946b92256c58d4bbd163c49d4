“Those tenants who cannot afford the increased rent will be evicted, according to the new lease agreement. “Tenants are also faced with high water bills, increased garage charges and increased electricity charges, and are required to pay an additional parking levy should they park their vehicles inside the complexes,” said United Tenant Association spokesperson Neville Petersen. A group of residents went to the Rent Tribunal in Wale Street on Tuesday and lodged over 300 complaints objecting to the rent increases. Communicare spokesperson Michelle Matthee said: “We aim to provide housing to households earning monthly incomes of R15 000 and below. “The cost of running and building such housing is quite high and we do not receive any operating grants from any government or other agencies.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The Takla Foundation, Jansen’s own initiative, hosted an event at the Atlantic Imbizo Conference Centre to celebrate Jansen and Myaka’s extraordinary achievement. Approximately 100 local schoolchildren and representatives from the M Cup Movement attended the ceremony, illustrating the wide-reaching effect of the charity challenge. Jansen and Myaka, visibly emotional during their speeches, reflected positively on their experiences over the last four weeks, even though they experienced difficult moments along the way. Jansen said, “(On day one) it was windy and when I came in I was so dizzy. And I thought, we had all the media here saying we’re going to do this - if this is day one what’s going to happen?” Myaka, after running a minimum of 42km for 26 days, decided to run 100km on the final day of the challenge - approximately the same distance as two and a half marathons. The distance runner said the social media support provided all the inspiration he needed. “I just keep on moving even though there’s pain. Thank you for all the support. I can see on social media that people are giving us big support. “I didn’t want to disappoint our supporters so I just tried to keep on moving.” Western Cape ANC chairperson Faiez Jacobs highlighted the significance of the event with regards to Mandela Day.

After a Victoria Road sewerage pipe sprung a leak on Wednesday morning, City Health was quickly on the scene, erecting signs to alert the public to the issue. Mayco member for Safety, Security and Social Services, JP Smith said the damaged sewerage pipe was swiftly identified and fixed by 3pm on Wednesday, with minimum inconvenience to locals. The issue is now under control, but Smith said confirmation of water safety has yet to be received, suggesting the public should still avoid direct contact with the sea. The cleanliness of beaches and the surrounding waters have regularly been prominent issues in the City, with Cape Town residents voicing concerns over sewage output around local beaches. While sewage worries remain in Cape Town, significant pride is taken in local beaches, with South Africa becoming the first non-European country accredited by Blue Flag - an award which focuses on the environmental management of coastlines and coastal waters. In the recent summer season (December 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018), 10 of Cape Town’s beaches were given full Blue Flag status, more than any other city in South Africa. The Wildlife and Environment Society of SA (Wessa), an environmental organisation which initiates and supports high-impact environmental and conservation projects, manages South Africa’s Blue Flag initiative. National coastal co-ordinator for Wessa Rob Slater said sewage leaks could impact on the number of beaches acknowledged by Blue Flag in the future. “If a similar issue occurred at an accredited beach, we would have to consider removing Blue Flag status until that beach solved the issues.” Blue Flag is a voluntary award, recognised in over 40 countries as an international symbol of quality for beaches, boats and marinas. @Peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The tour begins on Sunday with a concert in the newly refurbished Purcell Room in the London Southbank Centre - Europe’s largest centre of the arts. From London, the choir travels via Bath to Wales for the prestigious Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod from July 5-8. This festival yearly attracts up to 50000 visitors and 4000 participants, including 150 choirs, from across the world. The SU Choir is one of only four invited to perform in the International Celebration Concert in front of an audience of 2 000. The SU Choir will also participate in the colourful International Parade through Llangollen. The choir will compete in three categories - youth choirs, mixed choirs and open choirs. The choir will then return to South Africa for the 2018 World Choir Games in Tshwane, at which more than 300 choirs from across the world will participate. Because André van der Merwe, the conductor of the SU Choir, is chairperson of the artistic committee of the Choir Games, the choir is not allowed to participate in the competition. It has, however, been invited to perform as a demonstration choir. The SU Choir has been No 1 on the Interkultur ranking list of a 1000 international choirs for the past five years, but Van der Merwe emphasises that it is never about winning or losing: “For me and the choir there is nothing ‘at stake’ on this tour. My choir members know the result of a competition - win or lose - must never be allowed to determine who you are. “We are here for the music. We take part in a competition to challenge our own standards and to perform the music as beautifully as possible. Everything else is a bonus. “For every artist it is important to test his work on the international stage. It is a wonderful opportunity for growth to see how your own culturally specific repertoire is received in an international context. "We perform interesting music, and I am curious to see how audiences respond.” @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

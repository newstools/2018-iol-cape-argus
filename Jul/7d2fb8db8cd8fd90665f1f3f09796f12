The officers pepper-sprayed and manhandled protesters gathered at the shacks on Wednesday, leading to four people sustaining injuries. That angered residents, who set tyres alight in the suburb. Residents who participated in the shack protest said they did not take part in the tyre-burning protest but supported those who had done so. “We weren’t there when they started burning tyres, that’s a different protest, but we’re all together,” said Shahied Robain. “The City needs to come here and talk to us. I’m going to protest here until someone comes here and gives me some answers. “They (officers) came here to assault us without serving us with one piece of paper.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Robain was with a handful of protesters who said they were not disheartened by the removal of the shacks, and would rebuild them. Member of the mayoral committee for safety and security, JP Smith said if a charge was laid against the officers who tore down the shacks, it would be taken seriously. He said the protesters’ anger towards the City was misplaced as city councillors were not able to control development in the area. “Brandon Golding and Dave Bryant (councillors) can’t influence the outcome of the planning decisions,” he said. Development was undertaken in terms of national planning legislation. “Councillors had some influence on the sensitivity and insensitivity of planning, but they no longer have that influence.  The only policy mechanism 
they can use is heritage overlay (legislation).” @IamAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

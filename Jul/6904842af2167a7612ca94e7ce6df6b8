Inspired Stages, a company aiming to inspire young people through self-belief, self-respect and “the stages” of performance, hosted a four-day workshop at Golden Valley towards the end of June and a two-day bootcamp at GrandWest at the beginning of July. Both events were well attended, with many schools attending for the first time. Award-winning entertainer Alistair Izobell and Voice SA stars Jean Citto and Robin Pieters attended the event to offer encouragement to the aspiring youngsters. What makes Inspired Stages different is the incorporation of life lessons into the daily sessions. Alongside the dance, vocal and music masterclasses, organisers set aside considerable time each day to discuss topics such as perseverance, embracing individuality and overcoming fears. As a result, this programme not only provides young people with insight into a life on the stage, but prepares them for a successful life away from the spotlight. As part of Inspired Stages’ commitment to providing opportunities for young people, the company created a mentoring initiative aimed at young people over 19 who have been through Inspired Stages programmes for several years and have displayed strong leadership and role model qualities. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

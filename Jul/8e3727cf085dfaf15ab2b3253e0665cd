Canterbury, a fourth dan black belt and successful competitor in her own right, runs her own training group called Munifa’s Martial Arts Academy. She has taught students in Manenberg and Bo-Kaap, though safety concerns in Manenberg have restricted her visits. “We’re losing a lot of talent because of a lack of funding. So many people can’t afford to train, travel to the events, even buy the karate suits and club tracksuits. Sometimes we have to train in parks, which is just not a safe environment for my students.” In 2015, 11 of Canterbury’s students were accepted into the national team, but limited funds prevented all of these athletes from travelling to the world championships. In a video appeal sent to potential sponsors of her academy, Canterbury said funds were needed for the purchase of training and competition kit, event transport, attendance fees and club tracksuits. “It’s very difficult, but I get so much joy out of this sport. What I really want, though, is to inspire my students to continue competing.” @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

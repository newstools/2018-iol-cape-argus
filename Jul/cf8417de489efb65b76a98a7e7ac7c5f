Executive head of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health Professor Mariana Kruger handed the scarves to the Tutus and said they had been very active patrons of the hospital for the past 18 years, paying regular visits to the wards and organising fund-raising initiatives. Through their fund-raising efforts, the hospital had managed to acquire a Retcam that screens high-risk infants’ eyes to prevent blindness. Tygerberg Children’s Hospital is responsible for providing tertiary medical care to approximately half of the Western Cape’s children who need it, and the Tutus have a special relationship with the institution.      According to director of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation Razaan Bailey, the Tutus’ relationship with the medical industry and the hospital was a result of Archbishop Tutu having nearly succumbed to TB as a youth, and his wish to study medicine. Bailey said Tutu’s attempts were thwarted by a lack of funds to pay university fees. @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

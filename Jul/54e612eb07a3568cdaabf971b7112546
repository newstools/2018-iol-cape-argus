The body of Fredericks was found in a shallow grave a few hundred meters from his home in Woodlands. He had been missing since July 9. On Monday, Igshaan Hendricks - who was a tenant at Fredericks’ home appeared in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court along with Rashaad September and Nishaad Wessels. They face the charge of murder. At a previous appearance, Hendricks said he would be hiring a private lawyer, but yesterday told the court he would need a Legal Aid counsel. The case was postponed to August 28 for a bail application. The State will be opposing the trio’s bail. Fredericks last communicated with his family on July 12. Community police forum spokesperson Anthea van der Vent detailed how a community search led to the discovery Fredericks’ body. “On the Sunday at around 5pm the community joined in the search. We got information leading us to the bushes at Harmony Village. “We divided into six groups, and less than 20 minutes into the search we noticed that the grass on the ground looked disturbed,” she said. Van der Vent said she went to get a spade, and upon surface-level digging they came across a duvet cover and white sleeping pants. “As we dug deeper, there was a plank. We lifted the plank and saw him lying in a cradle position wearing a blue jacket, jeans and boots,” she said. Van der Vent said September and Wessels were known gang members but she didn’t know what linked Hendricks to them. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

According to the WhatsApp message, workers will only go to work when their leader are out of jail. Zwelihle residents in Hermanus gathered on Sunday to discuss the way forward for the week, and were split in their views on whether they should go to work or not. DA spokesperson in the legislature Masizole Mnqasela said: “A group calling themselves Zwelihle Renewal in Zwelihle Township, Hermanus, vowed to burn homes of all people who dare go to work on Monday. “I want to warn them that they will be met with the heaviest arm of the law. “This is a democratic South Africa, not some banana republic. Zwelihle is not an island. If any person is declaring war on the people, the police have a constitutional duty to defend law-abiding citizens.” Zwelihle residents at a meeting at the Zwelihle Taxi Rank decided to return to work today. Zwelihle worker’s forum chairperson Masibulele Jimlongo said: “We as the forum say all workers must go back to work, and all children to school as normal. “It is in the best interest of the community, the poor, the sick, the weak and the entire working community,” said Jimlongo Ward councillor Lindile Ntsabo said the community of Zwelihle was waiting for minister Bheki Cele’s meeting tomorrow and they would go to work and to school. “It will be business as usual,” he said. The situation in Zwelihle remains tense. After the community meeting, a voice note from Siyabulela Nontwala, one of the Zwelihle Renewal members, said: “We as Zwelihle residents have agreed on a peaceful stayaway. No work until we meet with the minister of police on Tuesday.” Community Safety MEC Dan Plato said community leaders had expressed a renewed willingness to end violent protests in the area. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

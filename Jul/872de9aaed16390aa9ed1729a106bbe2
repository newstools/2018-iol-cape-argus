This is according to Women’s Legal Centre director Seeham Samaai. Samaai, who welcomed the ruling, said there was still no legislative framework that upheld the rights of wives in polygamous Muslim marriages. “The court is the only one that can come to the assistance of these women. Many other women in the same predicament can’t afford to take the issue to court. “This reflects the unsustainability of it,” she said. On Friday, the Concourt handed down judgment that confirmed a Western Cape High Court ruling which found it unconstitutional not to recognise the rights of wives in polygamous Muslim unions. The Concourt ruling was made in the matter where Farieda Harneker, third wife of Osman Harneker who died in 2014, was denied shares to the house she, the deceased and his legal wife, Amina Harneker, lived in by the Deeds Registrar. This refusal was despite, her husband’s wishes as stated in his will, and the legal wife’s approval. The decline was on the basis that the term “surviving spouse” in section 2C(1) only covers spouses recognised formally under South African Law. Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) executive member Shaykh Muneer Abduroaf said the ruling was not that dynamic. “It does not make the Wills Act sharia-compliant in all aspects, though. “We therefore encourage our Muslim communities to execute Islamic wills. This case stems directly from the MJC’s Islamic Distribution Certificate issued by our Fatwa (Islamic ruling) Department. “Muslim marriages are still not recognised in terms of any marriage act. “We should therefore push for such recognition in order to have full recognition of Muslim personal law.” @Zoey_dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

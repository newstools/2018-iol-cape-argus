The FoodForward organisation, which is addressing hunger in SA, supports approximately 600 organisations in the country with monthly donations of food. “They’ve now partnered with Pick n Pay, so that ordinary citizens can get involved by donating to the cause. From July 13 to 15, volunteers will hand out plastic carrier bags in Pick n Pay stores with a printed list of items most needed by the organisation on it. Shoppers can then purchase the items. Organisations they serve will then be able to continue to provide warm meals to the 250 000 people they feed every day. “Current stats indicate that 14 million people experience hunger on a daily basis in SA. It’s a bigger problem than people are aware of. Through this initiative we can raise awareness on the issue and offer people a way they can assist. Volunteers will hand out plastic carrier bags in store and people can help pack on Mandela Day, which will go to our beneficiaries which include shelters, rehab centres, elderly homes and other organisations,” said FoodForward funds development manager Kate Hamilton. Do-gooders can register to volunteer at any Pick n Pay stores in Cape Town, handing out branded shopping bags. They can also get involved by spending 67 minutes at the packing events on July 18.

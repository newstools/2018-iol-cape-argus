UNAids, a multinational programme aiming to eradicate Aids as a public health threat by 2030, launched a campaign at the beginning of 2016, outlining its desire to identify 90% of all HIV-positive individuals; treat 90% of those affected with antiretroviral (ARV) therapy; and achieve viral suppression (an undetectable level of HIV), in 90% of those treated, by 2020. South Africa’s survey data found that 85% of people living with HIV knew their HIV status, 71% of people who knew their status were accessing antiretroviral treatment, and 86% of people who were accessing treatment had suppressed viral loads. While these results suggest work is still to be done, UNAids is confident the country is moving in the right direction. The executive director of UNAids, Michel Sidibé, said: “These surveys are incredibly important and play a vital role in helping countries review and refine their HIV programming to make sure the right services are reaching people affected by HIV.” Botswana, for example, has nearly reached its 90-90-90 targets, as 86% of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 84% of people who know their status are on antiretroviral therapy, and 81% of people on antiretroviral therapy are virally suppressed. However, new HIV infections have failed to decline since 2010. The announcement comes as Cameroon and Ivory Coast simultaneously released results from their recent population-based HIV impact assessment surveys. Both countries are struggling to keep up with South Africa’s progress, particularly in terms of identifying those carrying HIV. Viral load suppression among all people living with HIV in Cameroon and Ivory Coast, however, was less than 50%, reflecting low treatment coverage. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

These were the words of Western Cape High Court Judge Deidre Kusevitsky when sentencing prominent Gugulethu tavern owner Thembile “Morris” Vokozela. Vokozela, 52, was sentenced to an effective life imprisonment term for the murder of his wife, Regina Vokozela, 42. Regina’s body was found lying over a heap of clothes and toiletries at their NY 48 home in Gugulethu. An autopsy report suggested she had been shot 11 times in her body and five times in the back of her head. She was killed using two different firearms. On Wednesday Judge Kusevitsky said Vokozela’s action robbed their three children, aged between 15 and 29, of their mother. This was after he argued for a lesser sentence to take care of their children. Three weeks before Regina’s murder, she had lodged an assault with grievous bodily harm complaint. Vokozela was arrested and released on R500 bail that same day. A police report indicated that Regina was assaulted with the fist on her face, kicked in the ear and pressure was applied around her neck for a long period. Judge Kusevitsky said: “The attack was brutal and vicious. It took place at home in the presence of the children to humiliate her. Three weeks later she is killed in her own home as she was about to leave. He meticulously cleaned up the scene by removing cartridges and hiding the second, unlicensed firearm.” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The Pretoria based businessman, who left for Norway on Tuesday, will attempt to break the world Jet Ski record of 3000km, by skiing through the North Sea and traversing the English Channel, before skimming across the Mediterranean to Athens in Greece and setting a new record of 11000km. He will be completing the Arctic to Athens trek to raise funds for the physically and mentally challenged in honour of Mandela Day. “I am a man on a mission. I want to heighten awareness about problems faced by people with physical challenges and autism, and the best way I know how is to tackle an endurance challenge on a Jet Ski. “I do this in honour of Mr Nelson Mandela, my brother with autism, and in the memory of a great friend, sadly no longer with us. A tragic diving accident in 2013 claimed Adriaan’s life, leaving me devastated and I gave no further thought to Jet Ski adventures until recently,” said Du Plessis. In 2003 he and Adriaan Marais completed a 7 000km Jet Ski trip from Kenya to Cape Town in 57 days.

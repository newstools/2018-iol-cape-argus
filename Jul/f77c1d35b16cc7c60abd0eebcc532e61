It also shows that 57.7% believed patients should have the final say in when to end their life. The study was conducted between April 2016 and April 2017, titled “Medical Students’ Perspectives on Euthanasia and Physician-assisted Suicide and their Views on Legalising these Practices in SA”. It gives a new perspective on the ongoing debate of euthanasia and assisted suicide. Euthanasia means that a doctor intentionally kills a person using drugs at the request of the patient. Physician-assisted suicide is when a doctor intentionally helps a patient commit suicide by providing drugs at the patient’s request. Dignity SA spokesperson Lee Last said she was not surprised by the findings. “We meet a lot of doctors in favour of assisted suicide, but many of them are too afraid to speak out because of peer pressure.” Dignity SA was started by University of the Western Cape professor Sean Davison,who is lobbying for the legalisation of euthanasia. Davison made headlines in 2010 after he assisted his mother to end her life. He gave his mother, who was suffering from cancer, a dose of morphine pills, crushed and mixed with water. He wrote a book about his ordeal, Before We Say Goodbye, which was published in New Zealand in June 2009. Davison spent five months under house arrest, and was released in 2012. MEC for health Professor Nomafrench Mbombo said: “The Department of Health is committed to quality care for patients at all stages of life and would welcome the opportunity to peruse the study.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

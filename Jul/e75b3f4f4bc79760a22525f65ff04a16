It is set to protest against active hunting of baboons on Saturday. Founder Jenni Trethowan said the planned protest was in partnership with other animal rights groups. She said it would be held outside Constantia Village shopping centre from 9am-12pm. The demonstration followed the granting of hunting permits by CapeNature to two Constantia farmers which led to the killings of seven baboons. Trethoway said one of the farms, Buitenverwachting, had since revoked its permit after residents threatened to boycott its products. CapeNature said it granted permits based on valid applications and motivations provided by farmers as a last resort to mitigate human/wildlife conflict. “The applicants were able to prove they have implemented multiple non-lethal mitigation measures over a number of years to prevent the continued damage to vineyards and infrastructure without success, and experienced extensive losses,” it said. However, Trethowan argued there was lack of clarity around the number of baboons killed on these farms so far. “We don’t know whether baboon-proof electrified fencing has been used, which if maintained properly has been a good deterrent in other areas. “Have they implemented effective baboon-proofing for waste at labourer’s cottages and restaurants? Supplemental feeding of troops, particularly in view of the drought and fires in the area, may also provide relief to the farmers who are experiencing damage.” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

On Sunday, Premier Helen Zille’s spokesperson, Michael Mpofu, said the upgrades were a result of a provincial government working with the community. “This infrastructure investment forms part of the long-term vision to transform the urban landscape along central Manenberg into a Youth Lifestyle Campus (YLC). “The YLC will ultimately include a network of upgraded schools and after-school facilities spanning dozens of city blocks, connected by safe, well-lit promenades. “In support of this vision, the City of Cape Town is currently investing in various upgrades to public infrastructure in the community, including lighting, roads and parks.” Mpofu said this project has been in the pipeline since 2014. Through an extensive consultation process, stakeholders have agreed to a few options which may include; Silverstream High be retained as a School of Skills (SoS) and established on the former GF Jooste Hospital site on Duinefontein Road, a large new primary school be constructed on the Edendale Primary School site that would accommodate pupils from Edendale and Sonderend Primary Schools. The regional hospital will possibly be built on the site where Silverstream High School and Sonderend Primary School is situated. Mpofu said the none of the options had been finalised. In relation to the regional hospital, Klipheuwel Regional Hospital, Mpofu said provincial Health Department had finalised the business case. “Approval has been received from national government.” @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

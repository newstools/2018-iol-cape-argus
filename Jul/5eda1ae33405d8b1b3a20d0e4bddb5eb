Darren “Whackhead” Simpson, host of the radio station KFM mornings, arranged for lottoStar to give Inganathi Mafenuka R10 000 each month for the first year of the babies’ lives. Mafenuka is a 22-year-old student from Khayelitsha who is studying at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology, pursuing a diploma in IT. She lives with her mother and two sisters. The morning show presenters Darren, Sherlin and Sibs (Sibongile) said they wanted to “properly” welcome Mafenuka’s quadruplets into the City of Cape Town, while KFM 94.5 station manager, Stephen Werner, said they looked forward to celebrating more of their milestones. An overwhelmed Inganathi thanked the station: “I’m so happy. I can’t even express my joy. I will save some of the money for my babies. I will make sure one portion goes to medication, clothing and toiletries for them.” Inganathi’s mother, Luleka Mafenuka, 40, couldn’t believe her ears and thanked God for such blessings. “He is the reason,” said Luleka. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

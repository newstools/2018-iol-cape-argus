Every day the grannies and grandpas meet at Ikamva Labantu Seniors Club to do handcraft work like sewing, beadwork, and enjoy themselves by singing. Every year, the Relate Trust hosts an event to honour South Africa’s senior citizens ahead of Mandela Day. The Relate Trust chief executive Neil Robinson said: “We want to pay tribute to Madiba and to our seniors, who spend their days threading bracelets in support of over 100 causes globally. Without them we would not be able to do the work that we do,” he said. “These remarkable seniors, like Nelson Mandela did, are still contributing so much to their country, their communities and their children and grandchildren and we are extremely grateful for their role.” An explorer extraordinaire, Holgate conducted eye tests and handed out free reading spectacles as part of their Right to Sight initiative. “Giving spectacles to elderly people whose livelihood requires keen eyesight is a fulfilment of that mission,” said Holgate.   He added: “Through their beading bracelets, they have helped fund hundreds of causes and impacted thousands, their work is just magnificent” Agrinnet Dondi, one of the senior citizens said she joined the group last October. “At first I was lazy to join this group, until I was motivated by a friend, who reminded me of my late mother who was one of the participants.” Every bracelet sold supports these seniors who thread the beads to supplement their pensions. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

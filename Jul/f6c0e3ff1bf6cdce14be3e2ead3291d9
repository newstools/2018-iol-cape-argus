Celebrity chef Jenny Morris, known as the giggling gourmet, teamed up with Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages to host a soup kitchen. As an ambassador for the Food Forward Organisation, she used her platform to commemorate Mandela’s spirit. Morris noted, “this cause is close to my heart. It focuses on babies and their needs and nutrition. Initiatives like this make sure that they get fed”. Morris also oversaw teams who baked muffins to order, selling them for R20 each. She explained: “These sales go towards putting homeless people into warm shelters for the night.” There was even a DJ to liven up the spirits of organisers and volunteers at the event. Cape Quarter manager Samantha Gouveia greeted volunteers, helped them sign in and grab their aprons before guiding them to vacant spots where they set up their workstations. Volunteers sliced carrots, onions, and potatoes to be added to the soup. “Last year we made 1000 litres of soup. This year, we want to beat that,” said an upbeat Gouveia. “It’s a good cause and it gets people off the street.” In keeping with Madiba’s humble spirit, volunteers took time out of their workdays to help out at the soup kitchen. Many of them work at nearby offices and many gave 67 minutes of their day to join the volunteer tables. An employee at one of the companies in the centre, who did want to be named, said: “Nelson Mandela cared for children. “So we reach out to children, to the homeless and to the hungry to make them feel that they do mean something to us.” @Nour__Sal  nour.sallam@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

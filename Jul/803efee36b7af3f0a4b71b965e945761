Players from as young as 8 years old were able to enter the beginner or advanced tournament, with several impressive trophies on offer for the best players from each category. The competition, organised by the Friends of the Library group in collaboration with Rylands Library, has been running bi-annually since 2016, with participation rising gradually since the first tournament. Organisers were expecting around 50 to attend this year’s “Winter Slam” but were greeted at 11am by double that number. A logistical nightmare to some extent, but one the staff and volunteers were happy to work around. Hakeem Syed, chairperson of the Friends of the Library, was amazed at the growing popularity of the event. “We originally asked our caterer to provide food for 50 people, but as we realised how popular the event was becoming, we said to them. ‘Can we make it 60?’, ‘Can we make it 70?’ “The only negative from today is we have too many people.” The tournament is run by volunteers, all of whom devote their time to providing a safe environment where children and adults can hone their chess skills and develop new friendships. Syed and the Friends of the Library would like to thank the sponsors: Planet Mercy for the floating trophy; Prashad Cafe for 1st, 2nd and 3rd trophies; and Gatesville Mosque for catering. @peter197t  peter.thomas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Now the Muslim Judicial Council has expressed its deep concern over this phenomenon and decided to approach the police. “It is a huge concern for the MJC. We have made contact with the SAPS and told them we are extremely concerned as it has been a trend that Muslim business people are being kidnapped,” MJC spokesperson Mishka Daries said. Like the other kidnappings during which ransoms were demanded, the most recent kidnapping, of 65-year old Layaqat Allie Parker, is shrouded in mystery. The businessman was kidnapped on Monday last week. Parker is the founder member of the Foodprop Group, which owns the Foodworld chain of supermarkets. He also sits on the board of investment group Brimstone. He and his brother Rashied are partners in FPG Property Fund. The family’s lawyer and spokesperson Walied Brown said: “From the family’s side there are no further comments and they would prefer to maintain their silence. “The police obviously don’t inform us of every development as they investigate. There are many leads and tips which have been received. “Many of which turn out not to be credible.” According to information, Parker was driving into the basement parking of his business premises in Stairway Close, De Greens, Parow, when unknown people in a double-cab LDV followed him and at the gate forced the security guard at gunpoint into the toilet. They took his cellphone and locked him up. They then went into the basement where Parker was forced into their vehicle and they drove off. Community activist Hanif Loonat said he was approached by the Parker family after the abduction for assistance but he declined to assist them. Since 2016 four local businessmen have been kidnapped and later returned to their families. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

This is why the non-profit organisation has partnered with Chevron SA to develop Training Workshops Unlimited to help the mentally disabled with job development training. The organisation hopes to highlight their plight as July is mental health awareness month. The training workshops offer community-based skills training and job development projects in four workshops, based in Athlone, Mitchells Plain, Retreat and Khayelitsha. The programme helps more than 600 adults with intellectual disabilities “It’s estimated that more than 80% of people with intellectual disabilities are either unemployed or underemployed. “With the necessary support and skills development, they can be equipped for equal employment opportunities and socio-economic participation,” said Cape Mental Health director Ingrid Daniels. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

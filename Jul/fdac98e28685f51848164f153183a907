It is the first time that the World Choir Games, the world’s largest international choir competition, have been hosted in South Africa. The biannual event brings together amateur choirs from all corners of the world to compete in a variety of categories. “As a university, we are very proud of our UWC Creative Arts Choir, which emerges victorious at every national or international event, and continues to fly the UWC flag high,” said UWC’s deputy vice-chancellor for student development and support, Professor Pamela Dube. The concept of the Games, according to their website, is based on the personal experiences of choir singers who acknowledge and pass on human ideals through song, and who contribute to people overcoming conflict through their social interaction, given that music is the common language of the world and serves as a link between cultures and nations. The choir has won a number of competitions in South Africa in the past, including the South African Tertiary Institutions Choral Association Eisteddfod, the National Choir Festival and the Western Cape Choral Music Association’s Choral Music Eisteddfod. They were also the semi-finalists in the Varsity Sing competition, a reality TV series for university choirs. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

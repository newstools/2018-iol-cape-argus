Western Cape head of health Dr Beth Engelbrecht told the Cape Argus this week the manner in which the visit was conducted was traumatic to staff, with some threatening to leave. “The manner of the visit was experienced as traumatic - being confrontational, blaming staff personally and directly for perceived poor service delivery. This incident took place in front of patients and the public.

It interferes with their duty at the time,” she said. However, the select committee on petitions and executive undertakings has refuted the allegations, saying no staff member was “confronted”. “Dr Engelbrecht perceives the unannounced visit conducted by the committee on April 12 as confrontational and accuses the committee of blaming staff personally and directly for the poor services,” the committee said. “The committee would like to state that no staff members were ‘confronted’ as alleged by Dr Engelbrecht. “The committee, guided by the hospital chief executive, Dr Anwar Kharwa, spoke to various head nurses about the challenges faced in their various departments. “Nurses spoke freely of the serious challenges not only hampering service delivery, but causing a strain on hospital personnel.” Committee chairperson Dumisani Ximbi said: “Committees of Parliament are constitutionally mandated to perform oversight over the work of all organs of state, including those at provincial and local government level.” Committees would not waiver “from this important responsibility”, the committee said, “especially when it relates to complaints of neglect and poor service delivery as received not only from Ms Nobuntu Fuzani, but also from various other stakeholders including the Khayelitsha Development Forum.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Cape Town - The City of Cape Town's Play it Forward toy drive has been hailed as a resounding success. More than 100 boxes of toys and other play materials were collected. "I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the people who have donated new and used toys to all City libraries and at the Cape Town Civic Centre," Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille said. "Your generosity will go a long way in ensuring that children in disadvantaged communities have enjoyable childhood experiences. "When we started the campaign, I undertook to have these toys distributed to the Cityâ€™s 17 toy libraries in Manenberg, Atlantis, Elsies River, Nyanga and Mfuleni. "We also committed to allocating a portion of the collected play materials to 33 City-owned Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centres across Cape Town," De Lille said. "Mayoral Committee Member for Area East, Cllr Anda Ntsodo, and I have already distributed the first consignment of toys to the Dora Tamana ECD Centre in Khayelitsha. "Other area-based mayoral committee members were issued with a quota of toys to distribute to the City-owned ECD Centres during their roadshows. "More toys will still be issued to the area-based mayoral committee representatives for distribution to centres in their respective constituencies. "This campaign complements the recently launched 12 ECD resource libraries where books and recreational toys are used to stimulate the development of young children. "These centres will also be beneficiaries of the toy drive," De Lille said. The planning for the next toy drive has already begun. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

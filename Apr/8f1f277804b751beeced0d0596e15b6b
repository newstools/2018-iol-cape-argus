     READ: Cassper Nyovest to perform in the UK He then adds that he would've met the Queen and was close to packing his bags but because of work and self-discipline,¬†he decided to pass on the opportunity.   I was invited to go Watch Beyonce this weekend but I have to work. The crazy thing is, I was invited by the lead singer of one of the biggest bands in world, I probably would‚Äôve met Beyonce through him. I almost packed my bags and left but the way my self discipline is setup..... ‚Äî R.M Phoolo (@CassperNyovest) April 19, 2018     I WAS INVITED BY BONANG TO CHILL AT THE "VINEYARDS" THIS WEEKEND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LOTS OF CHAMPAGNE ,ALMOST PACKED MY BAGS AND LEFT BUT I PROMISED LASIZWE ILL HELP WITH DECORATING HIS "NEW HOUSE".SO I SAID NO,I AM VERY DISCIPLINED  #CassperDisciplineChallenge pic.twitter.com/1TdCCTbcA4  ‚Äî ROMAN‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (@TheRealRoman_M) April 19, 2018     Dj Black Coffee offered me one of his sport car but i declined because i just bought new pair of sneakers#CassperDisciplineChallenge pic.twitter.com/17RzYnW6eF  ‚Äî 12 May üç∞üçë (@bbm_ncx039) April 19, 2018     I was invited by Mama Winnie to come collect the signal because it couldn't get past the toll gates.

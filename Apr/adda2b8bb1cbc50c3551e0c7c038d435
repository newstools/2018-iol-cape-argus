A workshop was hosted in Delft, where experts and informal food traders were given skills to standardise food in the informal sector in compliance with the relevant health and safety legislation and municipal by-laws. Experts also shared best practice applications during the workshop. According to Siyabulela Mamkeli, mayoral committee member for area central, supporting skills transfer in the food industry and informal economy is one of the priorities in the City’s organisational development and transformation plan. “Apart from a representative from CPUT who explained the importance of a clean workspace to process, prepare and cook food, City officials from various departments also attended the workshop. We are committed to economic inclusion and skills development in this high-growth sector,” he said. He said most of the participants were informal traders who play just as important a role as businesses in the formal economy. “The serious health risk associated with the listeriosis outbreak still applies and informal traders should ensure that food preparation is done in a way that ensures quality products. With the necessary skills and experience, informal traders should be able to develop their businesses and progress into the formal economy. Informal trading is about job creation, community pride, and skills development,” Mamkeli said. He said the process to develop an informal trading plan for Delft is progressing. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

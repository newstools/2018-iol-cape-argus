On a positive note, however, at least one aquifer in Atlantis is adding 12 million litres of water daily. Xanthea Limberg,  mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, said water quality testing had delayed the bringing online  of the V&A Waterfront desalination plant. “The V&A Waterfront is ready to deliver water. We are just doing checks with the water quality. There was a slight delay at the Monwabisi plant due to the community protesting against the project. “The criminal elements also had a role to play with the delays,” she said. Limberg said aquifers were still being drilled across the City, but criminals on the Cape Flats had been damaging infrastructure. “We are on track with all our augmentation schemes, but there have been slight delays.” She said the Atlantis aquifer had added 12 million litres of water a day to the system, and the City hoped it would deliver “another 20 million litres per day”. Meanwhile, the average level for dams across the Western Cape for the week starting April 2 is 17.6%. In April 2017, dam levels were at 24.3%. Anton Bredell, MEC for Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, said despite some good rainfall over the Easter weekend, the average dam levels keep falling. “It needs to rain hard, and a lot, in the mountainous areas for our dams to see some recovery,” he said, urging residents to continue to use water
sparingly. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Idols SA Season 13 winner Paxton Fielies will be singing at the World’s Children’s Prize ceremony in Sweden on Thursday, April 19. The teenager from Cape Town arrived in Sweden on Sunday and she will perform at their prize giving ceremony from 4pm to 6pm CET. Fielies has been selected as the Foundation’s ambassador for its new initiative ‘You Me equal Rights’, aiming at advocating for equal right for both girl and boy children. Since her arrival, the starlet has had the opportunity to interact with the Foundation’s children and says being part of the World’s Children’s Prize foundation is a big deal. But what seems to be a bigger deal is tonight’s performance where she will be singing for Sweden’s queen, Queen Silvia. “I can’t wait for tonight. I would have never in my wildest dreams thought that I would get an opportunity to perform for the queen. I am actually warming up now to make sure everything is on point because I want her to enjoy my music. I am super excited,” said Fielies. She and eight other ambassadors will be awarded the Crystal Globe Award for their participation at the prize ceremony and in advocating for children’s rights. She is also being trained to becoming an active ambassador for children’s rights. In July, Fielies is also set to perform at the “White Nights of St. Petersburg”, an annual International Music Festival in Russia. The global music festival brings together young artists from across the globe. Fielies will stay throughout the three day festival and says she hopes to explore the place while there.

The computers, which come with Education Department-compliant software, will be added to 35 computers donated to the school by the club last year, to phase out the older models, which were not in use. Kirstenbosch Lions president Philip Bam said the club had been involved with Bokmakierie Primary for the past three years and saw the need to improve their digital access.

It will make a big difference in the youngsters' lives and give them better opportunities. “It’s great for them to start early, and their wi-fi connectivity should be active soon. We will make sure that the computer maintenance and a contact to an expert is available to assist them,” said Bam. School principal Larry Lewis expressed his gratitude for the donation and said he was over the moon that Lions Club and Rustenburg Girls’ had decided to collaborate and provide them with the computers as it was a need at the school. “We had a computer lab, but the technology dates very quickly. I am so glad that there are people willing to help. We need to empower our children and give them access to knowledge to use Google for assignments and projects,” said Lewis. Rustenburg Girls’ principal Michael Gates said the refurbishment of the Bokmakierie computer centre would enable the pupils and teachers to gain access to materials which would assist in lesson planning and administration. “It will provide a sound education base for their future. Rustenburg will continue to assist Kirstenbosch Lions and Bokmakierie in enriching the children’s education,” said Gates. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

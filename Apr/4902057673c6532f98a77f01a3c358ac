Now she hopes to continue making a difference as she takes on a new position as the first principal of colour at Sans Souci Girls’ High School. O’Shea started teaching in 1995 and until last year was the principal of Tafelsig High School in Mitchells Plain. Under her leadership, Tafelsig High went from having a 52% matric pass rate in 2010 to having a 93% pass rate. She said it wasn’t easy transforming Tafelsig High, but she felt it needed to be done.

O’Shea said at Sans Souci she wanted to bring about some changes, as she did at Tafelsig. “I am excited and nervous as all eyes will be on me, but I am looking forward to the challenges and taking all the resources and using them to the fullest and to connect with the girls. I did so much at Tafelsig with not many resources, imagine what I can do with a school that has all these resources.” O’Shea will start her new position today, 9 April. @yo_lisa92  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

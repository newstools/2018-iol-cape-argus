Cape Town - Saving water isn't just essential, it can also be fun, according to Cape Point Nature Reserve. The team at Cape Point are inviting people to participate in their #CTRainDanceChallenge. "One of Cape Town’s iconic Big Seven attractions is sharing the message that saving water isn’t just essential, it can also be fun, in a video release that encourages viewers to join in the #CTRainDanceChallenge," the popular tourist attraction said in a statement. "Cape Point, the must-visit corner of the Mother City, is urging visitors to join the attraction on its long-term journey to sustainability." Judiet Barnes, Marketing Manager at Cape Point, said: "As an attraction thoroughly dependent on our beautiful, natural surroundings, we have always engaged in responsible tourism principles. With the current water shortages, it’s our responsibility to encourage all visitors to join us in saving this precious resource. "Since dance is a quintessential part of our expression, what better way to share the message than through this powerful medium? Our collaboration in this will ensure that we’re able to provide a wonderful, enduring visitor experience, and that’s what the aim of this video is – to boost awareness and contribute to sustainability efforts in a meaningful way while having a bit of fun with staff in the process."   Cape Point, the iconic peninsula at the southern tip of Cape Town, is surrounded by the elements of sun, sea and air, and has established its sustainability credentials over the years by:
* Providing staff with water-wise training.
* Providing hand sanitiser in lieu of hand wash in all abolition facilities, to encourage less water use.
* Erecting signs in all ablution facilities, encouraging visitors not to waste water. It’s a gentle way of reminding people that there is a water crisis and they need to act responsibly. Most tourists are happy to comply.
* Making use of an effluent system that recycles grey water, saved from hand basins and taps, for flushing toilets.
* Replacing all tap washers at the basins to ensure that there are no leaks – an inexpensive and small effort which could save significant amounts of water.
* The Two Oceans Restaurant is also urging patrons to drink bottled water, rather than water from taps. The restaurant’s bathroom has taps that are fitted with automatic sensors, which switch off when not in use.
* The watering of gardens and vegetation has been stopped. "The attraction is committed to playing its role in contributing to a sustainable tourism industry that sees the city able to welcome visitors to world-class experiences while minimalising the impact of this on the built and natural environment," it said. People are encouraged to share their video, or create a rain dance of their own, challenging friends, family and businesses to get involved. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Winners Strelitzia Youth Development were hosted at a luncheon at the Bo-Kaap Cultural Hub, a re-imagined space of unity and celebration run by businessman Kader Miller. Strelitzia proudly paraded their trophy - in existence since 1948. “I invited everyone from Mitchells Plain and treated them to a lunch just to say thank you because a lot of effort went into winning the trophy, and we commend them for that,” Miller said. The group of 80 members is part of a youth development programme. The lunch took place at one of the oldest venues in the area. “The reason why I decided to have it in that venue is because we want to uphold and preserve the heritage and culture of the Cape Malay.” The structure the Bo-Kaap Cultural Hub was built in 1928. Guests who attended the event were treated to guest speakers and a few live performances. “This is just a way to say thank you for keeping the heritage of the Cape Malay alive in their communities.” More businesses needed to be involved in their communities and similar grassroots initiatives, Miller said. “This is all about our culture and how important it is to us and how we keep it alive within our community.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

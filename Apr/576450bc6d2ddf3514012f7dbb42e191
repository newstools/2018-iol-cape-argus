City of Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said police were continuing to maintain a strong presence. “We will only start deploying more staff if the situation becomes more violent but for now we have sufficient people.” By late Wednesday, the city began mop up operations.     The residents had a long list of complaints for their ward councillor to take to the council, among them a lack of adequate sewage and waste removal. There are only three toilets in Phumlani Village servicing 20 families. They no longer flush and have become blocked, with waste spilling out. The ward councillor could not be reached for comment because of a council meeting in the city. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

On Wednesday, at a full council meeting, the City approved the revised municipal spatial development framework, said mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron. The framework focuses on curbing urban sprawl and the regeneration of the city’s urban core to maximise “inward growth and transit-oriented development accompanied by higher densities and land-use diversification”.

The Western Cape government is still conducting hearings during which submissions about the further development of the zone are being made. There is also a court process under way in which a number of civic groups and organisations have opposed the development of the area. “The revised framework identifies the PHA as a unique area that requires a special focus within our spatial planning policies and frameworks,” Herron said. “In particular, we recognised that we needed to provide policy certainty around the future of the PHA. As such, the framework states clearly that the remainder of the PHA, consisting of about 2 100ha, should be protected, given the role it plays in resilience and food security for Cape Town.

Following on from the input received, the City included policy guidance in the framework to protect the PHA as a highly valuable urban agricultural area, elevating its status to that of a protected natural environment and conservation area where no further development will be allowed. “Furthermore, the revised framework only allows for incremental development in the areas surrounding the PHA. This relates mainly to the southernmost area of the PHA where land use rights were already granted prior to the now revised and adopted framework It is important to note that areas identified for incremental development are not a priority for the City going forward, meaning that the City will keep on servicing existing developments and maintaining existing infrastructure,” Herron said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

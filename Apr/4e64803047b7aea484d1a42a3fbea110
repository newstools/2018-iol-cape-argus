Comic Con announced on their social media platforms that the 'Game of Thrones' and 'Justice League' actor is attending the three-day convention, and that more names are to be announced leading up to the event in September. Momoa is most notably known as Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, from the Emmy-winning fantasy series 'Game of Thrones', and most recently as Aquaman/Arthur Curry in the DCEU film 'Justice League', where he stars alongside Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot.  The Comic Convention is the first of its kind in South Africa, with the anticipation of the event to be as high as the comic conventions that are famously attended in the United States. The three-day event is to be held from the 14th to the 16th September, at the Kyalami Convention Center. Tickets are on sale at Computicket.

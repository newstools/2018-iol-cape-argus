The City of Cape Town entered into a lease agreement with Cape Town City for Hartleyvale Stadium and Malta Park B. The lease was issued earlier this year. It is valid for two years and 11 months. Observatory Civic Association chairperson Tauriq Jenkins accused the City of not including residents in its decision about Hartleyvale. He said the association was never approached for input in the leasing process. RELATED: Cape Town football team cries foul over Hartleyvale lease “We want to know what is going on,” he said. Jenkins said for a club that was well established, the City asked a small amount for rental fee from Cape Town City. “Cape Town City is not a grassroots level club, nor was it doing a corporate social investment project at the stadium. “Paying R8000 is ridiculous. We want to know who determines leasing arrangement This is a PSL team, they can afford (a higher rent),” he said. Mayco member for Assets and Facilities Management, Stuart Diamond, said the lease was entered after an “open and transparent process” which allowed for public comment and objection. “Notices were sent to the immediate adjacent owners, ward councillor, sub-council chairperson and manager, as well as the relevant ratepayer association,” Diamond said. “Comments and objections were considered before any lease rights were granted.” He said Cape Town City were paying R8500 a month plus VAT, escalating at 8% a year. The lease is only for two years and 11 months. Diamond said the club had expressed an intent to build a 10-000 seater stadium, but no formal plans or applications have been submitted. Cape Town City chairperson John Comitis was unavailable for comment as he is in London. @Zoey_dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za   Cape Argus

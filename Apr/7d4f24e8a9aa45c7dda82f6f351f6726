Last month, Robben Island Museum staff downed tools to hand in a list of grievances to the management of the World Heritage Site. Among some of their grievances were salaries, contract workers and the repair of the ferries. “When you are in the working environment and you see this as a worker and the management does not inform you, it can be disheartening,” Mali said. The union has been complaining about the Sikhululekile ferry that has been out of action since 2012. An amount of R3.3 million was spent on repairs in the 2012/13 financial year. The 300-seater ferry has not made the trip across Table Bay since December 2012. To date, the museum has spent R6m on repairs. “This does show that the museum does not take the interest of workers into consideration and that they honestly don’t care,” Mali said. The museum, however, is adamant that the DVDs will serve as a benefit. “The purpose of the four DVDs is to process and edit recordings of ex-political prisoners into usable formats for Robben Island Museum’s public and outreach programmes. “These programmes form part of (the museum’s) public heritage education department’s mandate to ensure the narrative of the island’s history is preserved,” museum executive manager Gershon Manana said. Manana added that the cost of processing the DVDs was subject to a stringent procurement process, currently under way, and would be confirmed once a service provider had been appointed. “Regarding the issues raised by Nehawu, museum management will always encourage an open line of communication with the union and staff,” Manana said. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za   Cape Argus

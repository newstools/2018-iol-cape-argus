That’s how former judge and activist Albie Sachs described Struggle stalwart Zola Skweyiya on Thursday. Sachs was paying tribute to Skweyiya at a memorial service held at the University of the Western Cape. “Like Tambo himself, Dr Skweyiya was a natural democrat. He hated apartheid with a passion and truly believed in the Freedom Charter’s declarations that South Africa ‘belongs to all who live in it’, and that ‘the people shall govern’,” Sachs said. Skweyiya was a thoughtful intellectual who fought against injustices, selfishness and abuse of power.

General Zolile Wilson Nqose, a close friend and compatriot of Skweyiya, also paid tribute to him. “We can call this man a soldier because he genuinely cared for others. “I was once in a bad space and when he came to the Western Cape he wanted to drive me home. That showed he cared.” Nqose said Skweyiya dedicated his life to helping others. Skweyiya died last week after a short illness, just three days before his 76th birthday. He was the first minister of public service and administration, serving in the post from 1994 to 1999. He later moved to the department of social services, where he served as minister for a decade. He served as high commissioner to the UK and Ireland. Skweyiya was born in Simon’s Town and went to school in Port Elizabeth and later in Cape Town. He studied at Fort Hare University. University of the Western Cape professor Nico Steytler said: “Dr Skweyiya was indeed a man of action and showed this when he was elected into Mandela’s cabinet. We honour him for the work he did for South Africa.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The event aims to bridge the gap between religious groups and community organisations as well as cultural and educational institutions. The organisers of the exhibition have encouraged Capetonians of all races, cultures, genders and religions to come and share in the festivities over the first weekend in May.

The important facet is that we have a common destiny and we have to show a common humanity. The imperative is that this inclusive event invokes the spirit of Tuan Guru, a political exile in 1780 who redefined what a citizen of Cape Town should be - inclusive.” On display at the event will be a 300-year-old hand-written replica of the Qur’an. The art exhibition will profile and give exposure to established and budding artists, and youth from the townships will be brought to the exhibition and taught calligraphy and art. One of the barrier-breaking activities planned by the organisers is the Fasting For All initiative. Muslims across the world will, during the holy month of Ramadaan, fast from sunrise to sunset. The organisers have invited all non-Muslims to fast for at least one day and experience the reality of the less fortunate. “Fasting has a deep social significance for us and that is, when we fast, we experience the hunger pangs the less fortunate and poor do. “In that psychological state our heart softens for the poor and you start feeling empathy and opening your pockets to the poor. “We want everybody to commit to just one day of fasting with us. We have a day of fasting planned and on that day we can break our fast together,” Abass said. The exhibition will take place on the weekend of May 4, 5 and 6 run from 9am to 9pm on Friday and Saturday and until 6pm on Sunday. Entrance is R30 for adults, R10 for pupils aged seven to 17 and free for children under seven.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

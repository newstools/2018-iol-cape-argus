Officially known as Africa’s largest sneaker expo, the popular event attracts sneaker lovers, graffiti artists, rappers and everyone who loves hip-hop. The event is annually held in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein and Durban. There was plenty of live entertainment by artists such as Riky Rik, YoungstaCPT, Patty Monroe, Gemini Major, A-Reece and Tshego. The crowd went mad for the DJs who kept the dance floor pumping between live acts. DJs Ready D, Veezus, K$ and JJ Fresh were the hosts, alongside Smash Afrika. There were food vendors, big-name brand activations and live sneaker customisation, and you could even get a haircut from Lanco Martin from Mobile Cutz. A mobile team from Roshana Isaacs’ make-up squad was also there to do free make-up for the girls in the crowd. Mitchells Plain twins Caitlyn and Cailyn Daniels, 16, came dressed in Y-Gen apparel in honour of their favourite rapper YoungstaCPT. Worth “We waited for over five hours to see Youngsta perform and even though he just did four songs, it was worth it,” says Caitlyn. “This is our first time at this event and we are already looking forward to the next.” Organiser Zaid Osman, 25, from Sybrand Park, started the event five years ago with just 80 people in attendance. “We have come a long way and this year we have a different setting that takes the Sneaker Exchange to the next level,” he says. “I’m so proud of the growth over the years and the dedication given by Cape Town artists for his event is phenomenal.” Co-organiser Tebogo Mogola, 36, from Johannesburg says Cape Town people are more passionate about the Sneaker Exchange than anywhere else. “To them this is a culture, a passion and a love for fashion and trends.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

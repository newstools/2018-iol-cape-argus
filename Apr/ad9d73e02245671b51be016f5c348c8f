At least 37 doctors from the Vision Medical Suite, a non-profit company, will set off to rural parts of the Eastern Cape to offer dental and medical services to children, including those with cerebral palsy. The organisation’s chairperson Hashiem da Costa said they have been in operation since 2013 and received a call to help some clinics in the province.

We treat all the patients as private patients.” He said over the long weekend they will treat around 250 children, some with cerebral palsy. “We rely on private donors to do our work and have no corporate sponsors yet. “We felt that most institutions prioritise food and clothing, and medical was not as focused on. We felt there was a need for that. The model of our organisation is that people render their skills and they come and give their time.” He said they operate from Monday to Saturday and on one Sunday a month, which is dedicated to special care centres and private individuals. @yo_lisa92  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

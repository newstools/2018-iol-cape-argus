South African musicians who will be performing at the ceremony this year, will be leaving for Sweden Friday afternoon. Among them are pupils from Chris Hani Secondary School in Khayelitsha, members of the Jazz Yard Academy from Bonteheuwel and Idols SA winner Paxton Fielies from Bishop Lavis. They will be accompanied by musician Shen Winberg, cultural ambassador for the WPC. The musicians, also trained child rights ambassadors, are expected to visit Swedish schools, attend workshops with ambassadors from many countries, including India, Pakistan, US, Democratic Republic of Congo and Colombia. Three candidates have been nominated for this year’s prize: Gabriel Mejía Montoya for his efforts spanning more than 30 years to support Colombia’s street children, child soldiers and children in prison. Rachel Lloyd has been nominated for her 20-year fight against commercial sexual exploitation and domestic trafficking of girls and young women in the US. Lloyd is also a survivor of sexual and mental abuse. Valeriu Nicolae has been nominated for his struggle to protect the poorest and most vulnerable kids in Romania’s Ferentari. The initiative educates and empowers children to stand up for equality, rights of the child and democracy. The majority of the 38million children who have participated in the initiative since 2000 are poor and vulnerable. The WCP Foundation works closely with Independent Media executive chairman Dr Iqbal Survé and the Survé Family Foundation. Its main aim is to highlight the plight of children’s rights and the violation of their rights. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

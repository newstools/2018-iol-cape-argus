However, LLD PhD graduate Phindile Ntliziywana hopes to turn this around and inspire more people in the village to obtain their PhDs. Dr Ntliziywana, a lecturer at UCT, became the second person from the village to obtain his LLD PhD at UWC earlier this month. Ntliziywana was capped by the first-ever PhD graduate from his village, Professor Loyiso Nongxa, after Ntliziywana requested he be capped by his kinsman.

He said he is quite touched that I have asked him to robe me on my special day. “There are another two PhD candidates from the village and we had healthy competition competing about who would be the second doctor. “The only infrastructure in the village is schools built by missionaries years ago, so you can imagine what it looks like now. There was also a school built by our parents.

Ntliziywana said the non-profit Mhlanga Development Forum is dedicated to rural development and bringing opportunities to residents. It’s currently taking in donations of books to build an information and communication technology and library centre. @IamAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za   Cape Argus

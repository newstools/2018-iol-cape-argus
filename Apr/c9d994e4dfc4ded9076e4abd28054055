Sadtu general secretary Jacques Adams said the protesters were a group of farmworkers. Adams said the protesters, who blocked off the N2 in both directions, prevented pupils from attending schools. “Some of the schools in the area were half-empty, with only few learners attending on Wednesday. Protesters prevented cars and buses from entering Grabouw. They were pelting motorists on the N2 with stones. “Because of this, police and traffic officials had to block off the roads. Workers and children could not get to school. They did not want people to go to school and work,” Adams said. Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said they had to close the N2 for the entire day. “We had to close the roads due to the protests. “People were burning objects on the roads and throwing stones at cars. The situation on the N2 is still tense. It is also dangerous. We are asking motorists to use alternative routes.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

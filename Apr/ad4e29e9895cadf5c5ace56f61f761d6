Recent incidents of taxi violence in Langa, Philippi and most recently in Delft were putting the industry in a bad light, Santaco said. Regional spokesperson Vernon Billet said: “It is regrettable that our commuters have to fear for their safety.” Over the weekend, three men were gunned down at the Delft taxi rank and three others were wounded. ALSO READ: Cape taxi groups warn about increase in violence Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said: “Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident at the taxi rank in Delft Main Road, Delft South, where three people were fatally wounded and three others injured is under investigation. “A triple murder and three attempted murder cases were registered for investigation.” Delft has nine taxi associations registered with Santaco. The area’s Community Policing Forum chairperson, Reggie Maart, said two of the nine taxi associations were at loggerheads. Maart declined to disclose the names of the taxi groups at war. “The taxi rank is a constant challenge in respect to safety as it is near two schools. When there are shootings or any sort of violence there, the schools are left vulnerable. “The two taxi unions at war are keeping the community hostage. The worst part is that the rank is on the Main Road which is frequently used,” said Maart. He said the community had no say or input in the taxi operations in Delft. The Delft taxi violence comes at a time when commuters are heavily reliant on taxis as a mode of transportation due to the national bus strike. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

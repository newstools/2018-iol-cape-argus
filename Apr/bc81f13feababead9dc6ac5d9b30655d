Albert Mutuubloa and Vitalis Matema appeared on Monday on four charges of murder and one count of attempted murder. The two are among three suspects who were sought by police for the Brown’s Farm murders. The pair walked up to a packed courtroom. Residents from Brown’s Farm and families of the four deceased attended court.

The pair were read their rights and opted to get a legal aid attorney to represent them. Mutuublod told the court he was arrested at his home in Better Life Informal Settlement, also in Philippi. The case was remanded to April 16 for a Shona-speaking interpreter. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said police were still searching for the third suspect. Two minibus taxis were used to transport Brown’s Farm residents who had come to show their support to the bereaved families. Nolovuyo Bizana, a resident, said the suspects were known by the community members who often saw them in the community. “We never expected that they would be suspected killers. We just fear the one who is still out on the loose,” she said. Nobuhle Balele, the 17-year-old eyewitness, was also in court, but declined to speak to the media. She said she feared for her life. A shop owner, who declined to be named, said she wanted the suspected killers to rot in jail. “We don’t want them to be free. We feel unsafe.” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za   Cape Argus

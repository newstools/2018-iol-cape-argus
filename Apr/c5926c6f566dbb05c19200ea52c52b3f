“The meeting was very negative and we are not happy at all,” community leader Daniel Nomavila said. According to Nomavila, De Lille said a nearby piece of land could not be occupied because it was declared a nature reserve in 2016.

Then they (the City) told us we cannot live there. We are furious,” Nomavila said. He said residents were waiting outside in the rain on Monday for feedback from the community leadership. Residents vowed to illegally occupy a piece of land known as Xakabantu as talks with De Lille had collapsed. This despite a previous meeting between the residents and De Lille, after violent protests in the area last week. Protesters have continued to burn tyres and debris. The protest began  on April 16 after residents complained of overcrowding in Vrygrond and lack of access to land. De Lille’s spokesperson, Xolani Koyana, said: “The City will explore what action can be taken to free up any pockets on land in the vicinity for housing development. The forum was also provided with further information about a housing project which was under discussion in the first meeting.” He said the City would employ 55 residents from Vrygrond under the Extended Public Works Programme to conduct a survey on the number of backyard dwellers in the area. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Meanwhile, the SA Road Passenger Bargaining Council on Sunday issued a statement on behalf of the SA Bus Employers’ Association and the Commuter Bus Employers’ Organisation, confirming their acceptance of the CCMA’s proposal of a two-year agreement with an 8% increase in 2018 and an 8.5% increase in 2019. They said the increases are across the board on the basic wages of existing employees, as well as industry minimum wages and all applicable allowances. Spokesperson John Dammert said the mediators’ proposal was 5% above the current level of Consumer Price Index inflation, which stood at 3.8% last month.

He said these increases had happened despite a threefold increase in the price of diesel. The result of this is that one bus company is in the process of retrenching 350 employees, while a state-owned bus company has applied for a bailout in order to meet its April salary obligations and a Pretoria-based company has had to suspend services due to inadequate cash flow. “With constrained subsidy support, the passenger will bear the brunt of the exorbitant salary increases Our passengers come from low-income communities and on average earn salaries which are three times less than that which drivers are demanding. “It is really unfair they have to bear the brunt of the inconvenience of the strike and the spectre of raised fares,” said Dammert. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

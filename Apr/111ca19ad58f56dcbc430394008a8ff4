According to a City statement, the deeds were given to the families “in an effort to restore their dignity and assist them to triumph over the injustices of the past”. The homeowners form part of 915 others who were given homes in the area since 2016. They join others in areas all over Cape Town, which include Retreat, Athlone, Goodwood and Beacon Valley, who all received title deeds to their homes in the past six months. Mayor Patricia de Lille said that every month this year, Capetonians in various areas had received the deeds to their homes.

When we were elected into government, we made a commitment to change that, and to undo the wrongs of the past. “In my first term as mayor, between 2011 and 2016, the City has issued 
11 000 title deeds to residents. Today, it was an honour to meet some of the Pelican Park residents and hear their stories,” said De Lille. She relayed the story of resident Louise de Klerk, who lived in the bush on the edge of Pelican Park for 20 years before she received her own home two years ago. De Klerk  moved to Cape Town from Moorreesburg, endured hardship and cared for her children while living on the street. She is now working to improve her life in her home, which is in her name. “It was encouraging to hear from new title deed owners about their plans for the future. I urged all the new title deed holders to immediately make sure they have a valid will that would ensure that their homes stay in their family,” said De Lille. She also revealed that consultants had been appointed to start planning for the construction of Pelican Park Phase 2, of about 2330 houses. The development of a new R46 million clinic in Pelican Park will be completed in 2019. Staff Reporter Cape Argus

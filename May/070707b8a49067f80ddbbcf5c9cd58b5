It’s absolutely fantastic, they did a fantastic job,” said Warda Isaacs on Sunday. Store promoter Aasiya Salasa said the weekend had been non-stop busy from morning till night, with people queueing outside the entrance of the Castle of Good Hope to get in. “Since 9am it’s been busy. We were supposed to close at 9pm last night, but we left much later because it was so full. It’s going great,” said Salasa. The pre-Ramadaan exhibition is a first for Cape Town and it sets the scene for the coming month of Ramadaan, which is the spiritual month of fasting for Muslims around the world. The event, which started out in 2010 as a marketplace for Ramadaan shopping, has since grown into an event that focuses on community development and religious engagement - with the special aim of attracting individuals from all faiths and backgrounds. Spice Mecca chief executive Shreef Abass said the event hopes to reflect the teachings of spiritual leader Tuan Guru, who opened one of the first Muslim school in the Cape. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

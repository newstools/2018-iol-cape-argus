On Tuesday, Packham, from Constantia, appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court facing a charge of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Gill’s charred body was found, days after her disappearance on February 22, in the boot of a burnt BMW vehicle at the Diep River train station. She was identified through forensic DNA comparison.

He said it was also agreed that the defence would give the State Packham’s bank statements. “I have told the investigating officer to do a Section 205 application to access the accused’s banking details if the defence does not provide these,” he said. Packham was arrested in March.

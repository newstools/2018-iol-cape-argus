Cape Town - A childcare centre in Beacon Valley, Mitchells Plain, has been handed a title deed, enabling it to expand its operation and care for more at-risk children. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille handed over the title deed to the Baitul Ansaar Childcare Centre on Thursday. "The Baitul Ansaar Childcare Centre is the largest child and youthcare centre taking in both emergency at-risk children including infants, toddlers and older kids, and providing long-term accommodation for at-risk children servicing the Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha areas," De Lille said. "The lack of space over many years has meant that staff here have had the terrible task of having to turn children at risk away and that is something that we can never let pass without trying to do something to help," she said. De Lille said she began the process of transferring the ownership of the land in 2011. "It was a lengthy administrative haul until finally, on Friday 23 March 2018, the conveyancer lodged the ownership transfer instruction with the Deeds Office. "While I became frustrated at this process many times, I must say I am deeply grateful that I can finally place the title deed in Centre manager Moniebah Razackâ€™s hands today. "Moniebah, I want to thank you for your patience and for never giving up on your calling to help the children that desperately need people like you; and I also want to thank the staff here. "You were so patient and hopeful that one day you would be able to expand the Centre to allow more children into this safe haven," De Lille said. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

NEAD Community Development is now training women in first aid. This after emergency medical services (EMS) personnel were shot at and stoned in Tafelsig. EMS district manager in Lentegeur JA van Zyl, said the community would be able to respond to gun and burn wounds and paediatric emergencies.

It is six hours long and the women will receive certificates afterwards. “The training is part of the Department of Health’s outreach in communities. We have also presented in Nyanga, Manenberg, Gugulethu and Hanover Park. All the red zone areas for ambulances,” he said. Joanie Fredericks, director, said the training would be provided to 50 women. “It is accredited by the University of the Western Cape and the women will be able to help in emergency situations where communities have to wait for ambulances to arrive. We will ensure there are people in Mitchells Plain who will be able to conduct first aid. We are at the forefront to attend to the sickly and injured because the ambulances unfortunately have to wait for available police vehicles to accompany them. Now the communities responsible for hurting ambulance personnel stand to benefit from medical training. These ambulance men and women got robbed at gun and knife-point, assaulted, traumatised, victimised and humiliated. But now we are giving back with kindness,” she said. Fredericks said they were unhappy about the criminals who attacked the services. “They provide life-saving services to us. I hope they realise that this was wrong. Because in time of emergencies, ambulances are stuck at the police station. Due to the criminals’ stupidity by robbing the only people equipped with the specialised skills to safe lives, the community suffers.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

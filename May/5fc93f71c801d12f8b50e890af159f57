Stellenbosch University botany and zoology Professor Guy Midgley has warned that this may be the state Earth returns to if we continue to burn fossil fuels at the rate we’re doing. Midgley, who is a world-leading expert on global change and its impact on biodiversity, published an article in Science on the effects global warming will have on Earth,if drastic steps to decrease CO2 emissions are not taken.

Midgley said warming by more than 2°C will see 47% of insect species, 26% of vertebrate species and 16% of plant species standing to lose half of their geographic range. “You can put pieces of evidence together with what’s already happening and we can predict what increased warming will result in. “Warming by more than 2°C will take the world into a temperature state that it hasn’t seen for several million years.” Midgley wrote his article in response to a report from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia in the UK, which also published in Science, about temperature increases, which should be limited to 1.5°C. The study stated that a rise of 2°C doubles the risks associated with warming for plants, animals and insects. Midgley said with the current pledges by nations towards limiting climate change, scientists still predict a corresponding warming of about 3.2°C. “Even if governments and industry manage to limit warming to 1.5°C, recent research shows that large tracts of land would have to be made available for capturing and storing carbon. “Either way, biodiversity may get the worst end of the bargain, because the expanding land use itself could threaten remaining habitats. We need to stay as close to 1.5°C as possible.” @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

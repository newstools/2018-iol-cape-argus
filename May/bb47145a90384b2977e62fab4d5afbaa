The women have boarded a plane to Syria to repackage and distribute the goods, which are on their way to the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief Agency (IHH). “Two relief containers were sent in March from Cape Town Harbour to the port of Mersin in Turkey. The containers will travel overland to IHH's warehouse in Reyhanli. Women have been rallying from all corners of South Africa over the past weeks to fill the containers, and finally we are able to assist the refugees.

The women will pack family parcels containing tinned products, essential sanitary products and baby items, which will be distributed among the refugee camps in Kilis, Reyhanli and others on the Turkey-Syria border. Patel-Allie said the packages contained essentials that all families needed and were specifically selected by the Women’s Forum as many of the refugee families were unable to grab the essentials when they fled their homes. “IHH did a survey in the camps to understand what the needs of people are. There are many babies and children who need formula and nappies. Women are also in need of sanitary pads, toothbrushes and toothpaste, which we take for granted. “When they ran from their homes because of the war, it was the last thing they thought of,” said Patel-Allie. A third container with only baby products will leave Cape Town by the end of the month for distribution by IHH staff. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

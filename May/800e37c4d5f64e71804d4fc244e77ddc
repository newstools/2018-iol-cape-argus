Today, 100 years later, his gesture is being remembered with the firing of a volley of shots by the Noon Day Gun. Hands’s son, Reginald Hands, known as Reg, died on April 20, 1918. On May 14, 1918 - a hundred years ago - the Cape Town mayor led the observance of two minutes of silence in Adderley Street at noon, signalled by the Noon Day Gun.

A descendant of Harry, Reginald Hands, 67, said it was a very humbling privilege to be part of the Hands family. “Harry had three sons, including ­Reginald, whom I am named after. They were all very sporty. All three of them played cricket, two of them for South Africa, while Reg also played rugby for England.” It is alleged that Reginald left the country to fight in France after participating in the South West African Campaign. He died as a result of poison gas. It is said that as a result of the devastating of the loss of his son, Harry introduced the two minutes of silence that would be practised daily. One minute was to honour those who returned alive, and the other to remember those who had died. This gesture captured the heart of Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, author of Jock of the Bushveld, who had also lost his son, Nugent, in France. Fitzpatrick wrote a letter suggesting that King George V introduce this practice, which is now observed as part of Armistice Day. On Sunday, Cultural Affairs and Sport MEC Anroux Marais announced that there would be a volley of shots fired from the Noon Day Gun today at 12.04pm in commemoration of this day. Armistice Day is marked annually on the 11th day of the 11th month at 11am. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

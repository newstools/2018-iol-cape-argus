RELATED: Girl, 8, made to sleep in rape accused's bed by mom On Wednesday, the State had called Dr Bronwyn Inglis to testify on the post-mortem report she had filed. In her report Inglis said: “The cause of death was consistent with application of a force to the neck and the consequences thereof.” Inglis said Minentle had sustained bruises and abrasions on the face, chest area and in her genitalia. “There was some form of sexual penetration, but just at the entry and not deep inside. A laceration 27mm in length extended the length of the perineal raphe connecting the vaginal opening and anal opening.” Inglis said Minentle had sustained many cuts surrounding her anus and said for the injuries to occur a firm and hard object with significant amount of force would have been required to cause it. Judge Wille asked for a brief adjournment. “Can I ask some time just to compose myself,” the judge said. She said most of Minentle’s injuries were sustained on the face. “Injuries on left side of the face and bruises are consistent with blunt force applied. Her head was in contact with something like a fist or shoe." Asked by the judge whether the little girl put up a fight, based on the injuries, Inglis said: “There must have been some resistance against pressure applied.” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

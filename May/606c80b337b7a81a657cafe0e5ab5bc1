The regional seminar was also a collaborative effort of the SAHRC, the Department of Justice and the Foundation for Human Rights.” Participants of the African regional seminar included partners from government from the Department of Justice, the Department of International Relations and Co-operation and the Department of Social Development, as well as national human rights institutions from across Africa, including from Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda. “The high level of hostility experienced by persons on the basis of their Sogie within Africa was brought into focus, with debates and discussions around the many laws enacted, adopted or inherited which criminalise same-sex unions, with an understanding that solutions need to be sought for human rights violations of LGBTIQ persons to human dignity, freedom of expression and association, as well as their right to love and their right to life.” African News Agency (ANA)

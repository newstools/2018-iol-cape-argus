The students were exposed to the maritime youth development programme and were informed of the practical application of Sea Cadet skills in life, as well as in different careers. The first task they were given was to ensure they arrived on time at the Lakeside station and after missing their train, they were met by Midshipman Ruben Pillay who led them in a march to the unit.

After each 'evolution' (task) the team was debriefed so that we could improve our practical leadership and problem solving skills. “We each had to man an oar and learn the commands associated with pulling and once we had ‘shoved off’ we were out there on the vlei, leaving us once again to the midshipman and instructor’s mercy.” Ncetani said the Sea Cadets organisation was one that provided youth with positive alternative lifestyles away from gangs, alcohol and drugs, adding that many of those in her party wished they had similar positive role models while growing up. Ncetani said: “Our nation would be better if there were units like the TS Woltemade in each neighbourhood with adults who were prepared to teach the youth values, discipline, respect and teamwork. “Bravo Zulu to the officer commanding TS Woltemade, Paul Jacobs, in making the unit and instructors available to us for a very different leadership experience," Ncetani said. "A special thank you to Ruben Pillay and his senior Sea Cadets for exposing us to practical situational leadership. “These are lessons that we will all take forward in building a better nation for the next generation." @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

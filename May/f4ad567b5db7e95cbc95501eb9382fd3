Eleven-year-old Keegan-Lee Croy, known as “Apple”, is also actively involved in impoverished communities. Three years ago, she started the organisation Apple Socks. She has since given socks to many children at various organisations, including the Sarah Fox Children’s Home and the Red Cross Children’s Hospital. Her grandmother, Daphne, said Keegan-Lee enjoyed charity work.

Last month she also raised money to buy sanitary pads for girls at a school in Hanover Park. “She herself comes from a less fortunate background, but still gives to others. I am also a community worker, and I have raised her. We have taught her the principle of giving back to your community,” Daphne said. Keegan-Lee previously won the Miss Pre-Teen SA and Miss Universe SA competitions. Other competitions include: Miss Petite SA (2016), at which she won second princess, Miss Pageant SA Western Cape (2016), Miss Queen of the Cape, Miss Western Cape Modelling Champion (2017) and Miss Cape Flats last year.

This is according to forensic pathologist, Dr Deidre Abrahams, who testified under cross examination in the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday. In her report Abrahams said the cause of death was consistent with manual strangulation and consequences thereof.

On New Year’s Eve in 2013, Chauhan and her boyfriend Taariq Phillips - the accused - attended a rave party in Paarl. It is alleged that at about midnight, Phillips, Chauhan and some friends took drugs and went dancing. A short while later Chauhan started feeling sick. She and the accused then went to a tent they had been sharing, for Chauhan to rest. About an hour later the accused called for help as Chauhan experienced seizures. Defence advocate Joey Moses said a report from Dr Craig Franklin, who treated Chauhan at the Paarl Mediclinic, said the victim died of an LSD overdose. The matter resumes today, 3 May 2018. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

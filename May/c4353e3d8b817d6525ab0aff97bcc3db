Smith died this week after a prolonged hospital stay while recovering from a fractured femur. He served as dean of the cathedral until 2011. RELATED: Former St George's Cathedral dean Rowan Smith dies “Father Rowan Smith was among the gentlest, kindest, most open-hearted and loving human beings whom we had the good fortune to call our friend and colleague,” Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and his wife Leah said. “We send our deepest condolences to his family and the Anglican community. May Rowan rest in peace and rise in glory,” they said. Following his retirement, Smith was called back to assist with the activities at St George’s Cathedral at the behest of current Dean Michael Weeder. Smith served as a “de facto pastoral and spiritual coach and mentor”, Weeder said. Weeder said Smith had a good sense of humour.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

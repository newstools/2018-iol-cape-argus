The 23-year-old medical student from Paarl, who was crowned Miss South ­Africa at the diamond jubilee held at the Sun Arena in Pretoria on Sunday, said she watched the video of her crowning and felt as though she was having an out-of-body experience, with the realisation that she had won. LOOK: Tamaryn Green is #MissSA2018 “I watched the video of the crowning and it only hit me then, and I started crying. My dad is very proud and mom couldn’t say anything, she just cried. I wanted to enter every year, but I felt like medicine was the only thing in my life. “I love to interact with people and help them, but my studies held me aside. I knew that I would not be happy for the rest of the year if I didn’t enter this year,” she said. Green, who woke up at 5am, posted on social media, saying: “A new dawn rising. Woke up with a heart so full and content. Last night a little girl’s dream became her reality. South Africa I dedicate the next 365 days in service of you.” Green said she would not forget where she came from, and thanked all those who had supported her throughout the journey to victory, saying she wouldn’t have been able to do it without them. Green said she hoped to do the country proud. Congratulations on Green’s victory have been pouring in, including from UCT, which congratulated Green and Thulisa Keyi on being crowned Miss South Africa 2018 and Miss World South Africa 2018 respectively. UCT spokesperson Aamirah Sonday said the university was thrilled to have the sixth-year BSc medical student represent the country nationally and internationally. “The university is equally proud of Keyi, who is a BCom and postgraduate diploma in accounting UCT alumnus. From her time at UCT, Miss Keyi has always wanted to make a difference in her community and to be a living testimony to how people can transform their own lives. “Both Green and Keyi epitomise the kind of graduates the university strives to mould,” said Sonday. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

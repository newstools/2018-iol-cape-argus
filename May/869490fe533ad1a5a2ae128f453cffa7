READ MORE: Major shifts in Heart FM’s line up Abrahams’s daughter Linzi Coller submitted a letter to the radio station on why her mother should be chosen as the winner of Heart’s give-away. “My husband actually prompted me to enter. I am looking forward to my mom travelling, she loves travelling so I’m ecstatic for them,” Coller said. Abrahams was overjoyed. “I can’t describe it. It’s one of those things that never happens to you, it always happens to other people and it will take a while to sink in. My daughter has such an amazing way with words and when she writes or speaks about something she’s passionate it just rolls off. We have a very special relationship,” she said. Abrahams will be jetting off to Turkey with an all-expense paid trip sponsored by Turkish Airlines. Abrahams will be accompanied by her husband Denzil. They will be celebrating their anniversary next week. “We are delighted to have afforded Deborah the opportunity to travel and we thank our loyal listeners for participating in this awesome campaign,” head of programming Denver Apollus said. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

This year’s Slave Route Challenge was hosted in partnership with the Athletic League and the Departmental Council of La Reunion Island. The organiser, Fatima Allie, said the race started at 7am on Sunday. She described it as a great success. Allie said the event, which includes a 10km race, 10km big walk and another 5km race, started at the city hall, and ended at the Grand Parade. “We had a turnout of 3000 people in the 10km run, just short of 4000 in the 5km race and another 3000 doing the walk. We also had over 2000 supporters," she said. Proceeds from the entry fee, donations and club fees amounting to R65000 were presented to Leliebloem House Child and Youth Care Centre. Allie said the event was launched eight years ago, with the aim of encouraging people to celebrate their history. “Our campaign #MyCityMyRun, takes ownership of our city, which is a natural progression to where we situate ourselves regarding this event. “The route runs past heritage sites. For example, the 10km race goes up Penze Street - a cobbled road in the Bo-Kaap. We call the hill Koeksister Hill. A koeksister is a Malay delicacy. "Each person is given the delicacy and can then go and view the whole of Cape Town from the hill,” she said. Slaves were housed in the Bo-Kaap, viewed as the Malay headquarters. Allie emphasised the significance of diversity. She said the race symbolised the spirit of ubuntu and brought together people from different demographics and different ethnicities. “This race was about urging people to get together,” she said. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Shortly before being escorted down to the cells on Monday, Lamoer and Brigadiers Darius van der Ross and Collin Govender told Western Cape High Court Judge Rosheni Allie they would not appeal against their sentences. They also informed the court that they would not be contesting the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) order brought against them. RELATED: #Lamoer: Sentencing shows dirty cops aren't above the law The AFU order is that assets worth R67329.50 be seized from Lamoer, R 3324.60 worth of assets be seized from Van der Ross and R24594.44 worth of assets be seized from Govender. The AFU said the policemen had benefited from the corruption for which they were convicted and sentenced. Meanwhile, Dawjee’s lawyer, advocate William King SC, put forward a leave to appeal application on behalf of his client; however, that appeal was denied. Dawjee also contested the AFU order that was later granted by Judge Allie. The AFU’s confiscation order was for an amount of R50000. Dawjee was ordered to pay the amount within 30 days. King told the court they would petition for the matter to be heard by the Supreme Court of Appeal. The four were handed their sentences last Thursday. Lamoer was sentenced to an effective six years in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence. Dawjee was also got an effective six years, Van der Ross was sentenced to two years and Govender received an effective four years. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

It has been explained, for instance, that 'Maverick' will centre on Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell's time in the modern armed forces. Kosinski previously shared: "The Navy is very different now than it was in 1986. Back then, they hadn't been in any war for 15 or 20 years at that point. "Now, here in 2017, the Navy's been at war for 20 years. It's just a different world now, so you can't remake the first movie. It has to adapt." The original 'Top Gun' was directed by Tony Scott, and Cruise's performance as Maverick remains one of the most iconic of his career. The romantic action-drama film initially received a mixed reaction from critics, yet it turned out to be a huge commercial success, earning more than $350 million at the box office.

On Sunday, another clean-up will be at Hout Bay Mariner Wharf, at 10am, and will move to Lions Head at 2pm, for a community clean-up. The tickets will be handed out to the first 10000 volunteers, along with a goodie bag and T-shirt. The head of Nedbank Group Sponsorship and Cause Marketing, Tobie Badenhorst, said the campaign was in partnership with the City of Cape Town. He said it was about bringing together all the people of Cape Town to create a lasting Green Legacy, and to promote a culture of cleanliness. ”Nedbank prides itself on its reputation as money experts who do good, and the #cleanup4thecup campaign demonstrates what we are all about: bringing communities together to improve people’s lives and environments, “said Badenhorst. The Mayco member for Facilities and Assets, Stuart Diamond, urged residents to seize this opportunity to win a free ticket. “The Nedbank Cup is the FA Cup of South African football, and an opportunity not to be missed by any die-hard soccer fan. “So please look out for the details of the clean-ups, do your bit for the environment and you could be the lucky winner of a ticket to secure your seat at the finals,” said Diamond. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

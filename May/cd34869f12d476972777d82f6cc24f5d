Addressing public health officials who attended the imbizo, resident Lulu Matyolo said the number of children who were born disabled in the community had increased dramatically due to the lack of maternity facilities available. RELATED: Khayelitsha Hospital services slammed She said women who attended the clinic in the area had to stop themselves from giving birth due to the long wait before they were seen. “A neighbour had no money to call an ambulance and she was scared to walk to the clinic because of criminals in the area Finally, she got someone to help her to the clinic but was put in a waiting room for hours, up until 11am. “They then took her to Mowbray Maternity and her child was born blue and disabled because of that. She’s a single mom... those who give care have no passion for those they care for. They mistreat women who come in.” She added that Mfuleni needed a hospital and male clinic, but the government did not understand the concerns of the people. Resident Thandiwe Mthimkhulu said staff and nurses at the local clinic showed no compassion for patients and refused to assist anyone when the clinic closed at 4pm. She added: “On public holidays there are no emergency services for the community. We have to hire a car to get to a doctor. Why can’t the clinic open on public holidays? If we have an emergency, you have to go out to big hospitals in Strand.” TAC chairperson Vuyani Macotha said the organisation was meant to celebrate its 20th anniversary this year, but could not, due to the country still facing a broken health-care system. Macotha said while the Department of Health painted a rosy picture of the system, patients didn’t receive basics like the vaccine to prevent TB and those that prevent childhood illnesses. “You will go to a hospital or clinic and be turned away because there are no doctors or nurses available, or not enough medication,” she said. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.maay@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

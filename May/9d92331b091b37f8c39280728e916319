This telescope will be the country’s precursor to the Square Kilometre Array and will scan the southern skies together with the MeerKAT in a two-part spectrum and uncover more information on the unknown. The telescope will use radio, optical and gamma ray technology and bring astronomy communities together to achieve common scientific objectives.

To be able to simultaneously view and overlay optical and radio allows us to understand the physics of what goes on. “The study of exploding stars across the universe will gain a whole new dimension,” said UCT professor and co-principal investigator of the MeerLICHT telescope Patrick Woudt. Woudt explained that the MeerLICHT telescope, which was created through a collaboration between the Netherlands, South Africa and the UK, was purpose-built to combine excellent resolution with a wide field of view. Professor Paul Groot of Radboud University in the Netherlands said the science, which was starting with the telescope, would accelerate in the next few months and allow South Africa to share the data they gain with the world. “The whole observatory is dedicated to transient follow up and will put South Africa in the lead in the future. No one has done this before; it’s the first time we’re doing simultaneous analysis. We’ll be staring at the same field, so if we see something interesting, we’ll be able to ask the other team if they saw something interesting a minute-and-a-half ago. “It’s pretty exciting. Anything we’ll see we’ll share with the world. We’re training a lot of people to process the data and build up the skill set in students with projects like this.” @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

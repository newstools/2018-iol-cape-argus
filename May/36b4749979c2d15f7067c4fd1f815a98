The six pensioners who live in Rocklands, Mitchells Plain say they have no problem spending a few hours every week to equip the youngsters with their “legendary skills”. The feisty seniors started the knitting project under the Seaview Neighbourhood Watch banner and make use of a broken container which belongs to the neighbourhood watch.

But these pensioners don’t let the harsh conditions stop them from sharing their craft skills.” Twenty-five girls and boys come once a week to learn how to stitch and knit. Corine Solomons, 63, says: “It’s nice to see our kids coming every week. They show excitement and eagerness to learn the skill of knitting and are tasked with knitting a handbag and a teddy bear. “They also learn to knit with plastic, which is part of recycling, and the idea is to have a market day where they can sell and display their knitting. “This keeps kids away from negative influences and helps them to become creative in ways other than crime.” The oldest member of the group is 76 and the youngest student is just six.

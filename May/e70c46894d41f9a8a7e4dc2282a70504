Our forces will remain in the area until we are satisfied that law and order has been restored,” Van Wyk said. On Monday, backyard dwellers started rebuilding their structures, which were demolished by law enforcement officers during protests over housing in the area on Monday. This comes after another group of about 120 people erected informal structures on a piece of land they had illegally occupied in Woodlands. One of the women who erected a structure the field, Barbara Matthews, said: “Our house is so overcrowded that some of us have to sleep in the kitchen and living room. We have a three-bedroom house with 20 people living there. You can imagine how it is in the mornings when everyone has to use the bathroom. “My dad is sleeping outside in the car now, so that my child and I could sleep in the bed next to my mom. All my parents want is that houses are built, so that we can move out of the house. In 2012, 2013 and 2015 the council told us that they would be building houses in Woodlands. But nothing came of it. This is why they must understand why people are protesting,” she said. Lutfiha Meyer said she had been on the housing waiting list for 20 years. “We live in a small room in my mother’s house. I have three children,” she said. Munier Baxter, who also erected a structure on the field, said: “I have been staying with my wife and seven children in a wendy house for five years. As a man, you want your family to live in a decent house,” he said. @RusanaPhilander  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Fredie Blom also had a special visit from the MEC for social development, Albert Fritz. ALSO READ: Happy 114th birthday Fredie Blom! Blom’s wife, Jeanette, said: “We are overjoyed by all the cakes and presents he received today. I also want to thank the MEC for visiting Freddie in our humble home. “I always saw him on TV. We did not have money to even buy him a cake but now he has been blessed. “He had a tough life but it is through his good heart that God blessed him with so many years.” Fredie Blom only had this to say: “Thank you everyone for making this day special for me.” Fritz said that as the MEC for social development he had to congratulate Blom on his birthday. “We have to honour the aged. He is also the oldest man in the world and that is why we also have to celebrate his birthday.” The man who initiated the party, Earl Hendricks, said he was ecstatic about Tuesday’s response. “All I wanted was one birthday cake for him but he received five. I’m glad that I could make his day,” he said. Delft Senior Forum, which has in previous years organised birthdays for Blom, said it was a great birthday. Gadieja Francis, a community worker, said: “We told the media about Mr Blom’s age.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

She added that the organisation had processes in place to train and sensitise their members at all levels of the organisation regarding matters of sex and power abuse. “We all agreed that sexual misconduct is unacceptable, and have agreed to work together on a new policy for NGOs and NPOs working in our schools. We will await the outcome of the investigations, which EE is hoping will be finalised within the next few weeks, before deciding whether we need to take further action,” she said. The DA has also called for an audit to be conducted on all NGOs working in Gauteng schools to ensure all employees are vetted, so that no one accused of sexual harassment is hired to work with young children. “These allegations are serious as EE does a lot of work with young impressionable schoolchildren, and we cannot allow our children to be mentored by sexual predators,” said DA education spokesperson Ashor Sarupen. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

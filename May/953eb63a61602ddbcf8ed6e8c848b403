“So far it’s been great meeting new people, and very educational reading the news,” said Grade 10 Edgemead High School pupil, Kimia Valloo. “It’s a lot more enjoyable than we expected, and we thought it would be boring but we get to meet a lot more people and have a lot more fun. “Sometimes you forget to get the papers and sometimes it’s rush studying.” RELATED: Pupils, teachers keyed up for #HighSchoolsQuiz Bronwyn Paulo, the teacher in charge of managing Edgemead High School’s Team A, said that the experience for the pupils had been exciting as many of them were participating for the first time. “I think the fact that they are meeting new people and meeting new schools has been a highlight, and they get excited to speak about the news and getting to learn more. “It’s been impressive seeing how much they can absorb as some of the questions I don’t even know the answers to.” The annual quiz covers topics from politics, sport, entertainment to general news. This year, the winning school will receive R35000 and the winning team will receive R3000 per team member. Up for grabs are also two bursaries offered by the Community Chest. This will also be the first time that the top two teams of the Cape Argus Food Lover’s Market High Schools Quiz will go on to compete in the National High School Quiz.

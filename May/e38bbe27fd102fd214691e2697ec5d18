His door was “banged open by three unknown guys”. “Three guys kicked (open) my office door and ordered me to keep quiet, pointing at us with a gun,” said Maqubela.

He urged the Department of Education to help their schools with security and good fencing, “Our schools are not secured and with these technological devices we get from the Department of Education we become victims. This not only happens at my school. It also happened at Ntshayelelo and Mangaliso primary schools in the area,” said Maqubela. A traumatised Nozuko Nongongo, the school’s librarian, said she and another teacher were busy sorting exam papers in the staff room when three men entered and demanded cellphones and money. “The next minute they pushed us and shot on the floor. The bullet jumped from the floor and hit Fundile Tyalani, a Grade 1 teacher. Luckily it did not penetrate his body, but got stuck in his jacket,” said Nongongo Phumla Mayekiso, a parent of Grade 4 learner Elethu Mayekiso, said she heard the news from her son. She urged the Department of Education to take action. “Our children are not safe at all,” she said Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said regular patrols are being conducted at the school. No arrests have been made. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

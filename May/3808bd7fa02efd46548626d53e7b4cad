Today, local celebrities will join forces with Wimpy to support the Reach For A Dream Foundation. And for four rowers from UCT, this is a very special time. “Wimpy has for years played a huge role in my life; my mother worked for Wimpy previously and I always took part in their projects and I was always involved with Slipper Day because it’s such a wonderful cause,” Georgi Sabio said. Sabio and her three friends, all rowers from UCT, purchased their wristbands on Thursday at Wimpy in the Golden Acre. “We live very busy lives and we don’t really have time to give back to communities. Rowing with this initiative is something very easy for us,” she said. Last year Wimpy raised over R1.4 million from the sales of Slipper Day bracelets (R10) in-store. Wimpy also gave away 33 276 cups of free Famous Wimpy Coffee on Slipper Day to all who came through with their wristbands and slippers.   “We were incredibly proud of how much we were able to raise last year through the sale of Slipper Day wristbands, but this year we want to aim a little higher. “We want to challenge all South Africans to come out, buy their wristbands, rock their slippers today and help us to raise even more money to make the hopes and dreams of little ones across the country come true,” said Jacques Cronje, marketing executive at Wimpy South Africa. “I am hoping to take this initiative to other clubs to give back to communities and to give back little ways,” Sabio said. Reach For A Dream was established in 1988. The organisation makes dreams come true for children suffering from terminal illnesses. Through Reach For A Dream, hundreds of South African kids have been able to enjoy the simple things many of us take for granted. They are also often given the chance to explore the extraordinary, by swimming with dolphins or meeting their lifelong heroes. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

She said there was a time when the shift working hours were 46 hours, when it took 10 days to bring in a vessel for berthing and when vessels were lining up at the port, and at a time when the truck turnaround time within the terminal was averaging about 110 minutes against a target of 45 minutes.

I don’t see why we can’t introduce it in Cape Town,” she said. Sithole said when it came to containers it was important to have a single source of information.

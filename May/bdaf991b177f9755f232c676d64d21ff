The project was started three months ago by Jamielah Liede­man, who was bus company Golden Arrow’s first female driving instructor, and Joanie Fredericks, director of the NEAD Community Development organisation. Fredericks said the programme was very successful. ALSO READ: Free classes place women in driving seat “We had a 100% pass rate. Every day, women are registering for the classes. We have six classes every week. So far 15 women have passed their learner’s licences. These women always wanted to drive but did not have money for classes. We present it to them free. The youngest student we had was 17, with the eldest 64 years old. To see their faces after passing the learner's class was priceless,” she said. Fredericks added: “We had to stop the driving classes when our borrowed car broke down. So we are looking for a sponsorship of a vehicle. Anyone who can assist, please let me know.” She can be contacted on 076 921 6767.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

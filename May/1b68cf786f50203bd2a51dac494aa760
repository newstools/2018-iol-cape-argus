The Blitzbokke have come on board and hope to encourage others to join the Tekkie Tax initiative, which impacts the lives of many through the charities they fund each year which includes Cansa, SAVF, Epilepsy SA, etc. PICS and VIDEO: Stormers share the gift of a smile “We have a new collection of shoelaces each year and the Blitzbokke will be training in our laces. It’s a big moment for us. They’re showing us where their heart lies. “We’re raising funds for 275 local NGOs in different categories of ABCDE: A is for animals, B for bringing hope, C for children, D for disability and E for education. You can buy stickers or shoe laces to support. If you buy shoelaces for R35 or stickers for R10 the money goes into a sector,” said Tekkie Tax chief executive Germa Hatting. Hatting said the organisation was focused on creating additional awareness around Tekkie Tax and the work they do for the various charities in the country by helping them to take ownership for their own sustainability. Hatting encouraged all to do their bit by getting out there and buying stickers and shoelaces to wear next week Friday on International Tekkie Tax Day. The laces and stickers can be bought at Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Shaun Bloch, brother to education expert Graeme Bloch and brother-in-law to political activist Cheryl Carolus, said the family asked the pair to move out of the double-storey house.

But because it was our family home and they were used to it, they did not want to move. Describing the day he found the couple’s bodies, Bloch said he became worried when he did not hear anything from them early on Saturday morning. The last time he spoke to Jackson was on Thursday, when they made an appointment for breakfast on ­Saturday morning. “When I called at about 7.30am they did not answer their phone. Because I have a key, I went to the house and opened it. I saw my mom sitting in the lounge. Her face was covered with pillows, and I thought she was sleeping. “But when I took the cushions from her face, I saw her mouth was gagged with tape. She was very cold and I knew she was dead. It looked like she was ­suffocated with pillows. I found Aubrey in the study with a wound to his head. I immediately called the police,” Bloch said. The police were still investigating and detectives are following up leads, while experts were combing the scene for clues.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

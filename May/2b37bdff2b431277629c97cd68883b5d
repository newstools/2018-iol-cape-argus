The charity event, which will take place on May 25, will comprise a gala dinner and charitable auction at the One&Only in Cape Town, followed by a golf tournament where Keating will partner with Gary Player. They decided to host the event after being inspired by the loss of Player’s and Keating’s mothers to cancer. The funds raised will be donated to the upgrading of the hospital’s oncology unit, administered by the Children’s Hospital Trust.

Guests at A Night with Ronan Keating will be treated to a private performance by Keating alongside some special guest performers. The charity auction will host a range of items and bucket-list experiences up for bid and all proceeds will be donated to the hospital. Player - who has raised more than $64 million (R805m) for charity to date and aims to raise $100m by 2025 - will be at the golf tournament, the gala dinner and the auction. “I am so glad Ronan has chosen my home country as the location for this remarkable event and a locally based beneficiary. I am thrilled that I can support him after he has done the same for me and my charitable efforts for so many years,” he said. The hospital was selected as the beneficiary by The Ronan Keating Foundation, which is managed through the Citadel Philanthropic Fund headed by former Springbok captain Jean de Villiers.

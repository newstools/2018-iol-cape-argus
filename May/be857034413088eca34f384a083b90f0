MEC Anton Bredell’s spokesperson, James-Brent Styan, said dam levels were at 15.8% last week. “On the positive side, there is a small increase, but of course it’s not close to where we need to be, and we have now entered our winter rainfall season.

We want to continue to urge the public not to become complacent. We need to allow the rain to recover our dams as far as possible.” Styan said an average of 16.6% was a very concerning position to be in. The City of Cape Town said water consumption was trending in the right direction despite the recent rain. The city council said water consumption over the past week had reached a record low, but warned there was still more work to be done. The executive deputy mayor, Ian Neilson, said residents had been using a record low of 505 million litres per day over the past week, and dam levels had gone up. “Although recent consumption data reflects great commitment from residents, we are still to reach our target of 450 million litres per day. In order to meet this target we not only need to remain committed, but also to work smarter. Knowing how much water one uses for washing dishes and clothes, and showering instead of bathing, can go a long way, especially when we have such little margin for error,” he said. He added that the record low of water consumption was testament to how Capetonians had taken on the responsibility to use water conscientiously. “These efforts will go a long way to ensuring that the City makes it safely through the winter,” said Neilson. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

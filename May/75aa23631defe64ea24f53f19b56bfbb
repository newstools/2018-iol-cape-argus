Sutherland is also where the Southern African Large Telescope is located. It has a 10m class optical telescope for spectroscopy. Today the MeerLICHT optical telescope there will be permanently linked to the MeerKAT radio telescope. It is South Africa’s precursor to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The principal of Sutherland High School, Persephonie van der Ross, said they were very impressed with the new laboratory.

And today we are launching it. “With the SKA being in Sutherland the pupils are excited about science now. They are in awe of the new laboratory,” she said. The school’s science teacher, Erika Burger, said: “This new science lab has made the science lessons much more interesting. The pupil are more enthusiastic because we are doing more science experiments,” she said. One of the pupils at the school, Murial Jonkers, said: “I enjoy science. I am going to study medicine next year and I need science.” Lucrecia Claasen, another pupil, said: “We are ecstatic about our new science lab. I have learnt a lot.” @RusanaPhilander  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

This followed protests, and land invasions, in Parkwood, Mitchells Plain, Siqalo, Vrygrond, Hermanus, Khayelitsha and Suurbrak in the Overberg. RELATED: Parkwood land protest erupts in violence Over the weekend backyard dwellers from Parkwood occupied a stretch of land. They said the land, located next to Prince George Drive, had been earmarked for housing. Further reflecting the increase in protests, more land invasions took place in Hermanus last week and recently about 3000 people occupied land next to Spine Road. On Tuesday, residents of Kewtown took to the streets. One resident, Natasha Small, said: “The health services in this area are poor. There is no baby clinic and we also do not have a 24-hour emergency maternity unit. We demand better services. In the Kewtown community there are a lot of mothers with sick children.” Rashieda Stellenboom, another resident, said she was also protesting about housing. “I have been staying with my three children in a small wendy house in a backyard. We have been living there for four years. My youngest child, who is four years old, has cerebral palsy. I am on the housing waiting list, but we require a house urgently,” she said. The councillor for Kewtown, Rashid Adams, said he was aware of the protest but not the issues raised by the community. “It was an illegal gathering. There are clinics in Silvertown and Hazendal. In 2000 there were 151 houses built. We can’t guarantee that the city will build houses in the next two to three years in the area,” he said. Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said previously: “While we respect people’s right to protest, violence and destruction cannot be tolerated.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

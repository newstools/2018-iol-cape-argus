CAPE TOWN – Proteas
star AB de Villiers has announced his retirement from all international
cricket. The
right-handed batsman, who has just completed the IPL season for the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), made the surprise announcement on Wednesday in a video
recorded at the Tuks Cricket Oval in Pretoria. “I want to
let you know that I have decided to retire from all international cricket with
immediate effect,” De Villiers said. “After 114
Test matches, 228 one-day internationals, and 78 T20 Internationals, it is time
for others to take over. I’ve had my turn, and to be honest, I’m tired. “This is a
tough decision. I thought long and hard about it, and I’d like to retire while
still playing decent cricket. “And after
the fantastic series wins against India
and Australia,
now feels the right time to step aside. “It would
not be right for me to pick and choose where and when, and in what
format, I play for the Proteas. “For me, in green and gold, it must be everything, or
nothing.” The 34-year-old De Villiers ended with 22 Test hundreds and
8 765 Test runs, at an average of 50.66, and in ODIs, he scored 9 577
runs, with 25 hundreds and an average of 53.50.   “I will always be grateful for my teammates, the coaches and the staff of Cricket South Africa for their support through all these years. “It’s not about earning more somewhere else. It’s about running out of gas, and feeling that it’s time to move on. Everything comes to an end. “To cricket fans around South Africa, and around the world, thank you very much for your kindness, your generosity, and today, for your understanding.

In fact, I hope I can continue to be available for the Titans in domestic cricket. “And I will remain the biggest supporter of Faf du Plessis and the Proteas.

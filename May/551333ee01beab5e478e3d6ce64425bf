The Idols SA Season 13 winner Paxton Fielies has just released a new single off her upcoming album, This Is Me, and has shown another side to her. The single, called Angifuni,  sees the Cape Town resident singing in both English and isiZulu as she warns some spicy girl to "keep a leash on her man" because she doesn't want him. The album will be released on 1 June, but Angifuni is available on all digital platforms and features collaborations with Tresor, Craig Lucas and Kyle Deutsch.     It is here! #Angifuni is here!

The young starlet was also in Sweden earlier this month where she met Swedenâ€™s longest serving queen, Her Majesty Queen Silvia. Paxton was invited to perform for the Queen as part of the World's Children's Prize Foundation. Paxton was also awarded the role of ambassador for the Queen's "You, Me: Equal Rights" campaign, and was presented with a crystal globe as acknowledgement.

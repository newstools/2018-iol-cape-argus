Cape Town Fire and Rescue’s Theo Layne said: “Just before 4am Sunday morning the city’s fire rescue services responded to a fire at Fredrick Road in the Vrygrond, Muizenberg, area. One adult male and two male minors sustained fatal burns.” Officials are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze. Humphreys Nkhoma and his three children, Chiyamiko Nkhoma, 4 months, Mbali Nkhoma, 6, and Wakanko Nkhoma,11, died in the fire that gutted their home.

She said it looked like the husband and wife were intoxicated and appeared to be fighting. “The wife managed to escape but the children and the husband died. They were very nice people, always friendly,” she said. Vrygrond community forum member Isaac Goliat said this was a clear indication of the living conditions of residents. “This is why they want to occupy that land because the people need houses and they are angry at their living conditions,” he said. Violence in Vrygrond over decent housing flared last week and the situation remains tense since angry residents and law enforcement clashed. Earlier this month, protesting residents looted a bottle store in the area and targeted a private property, setting three vehicles alight and petrol-bombing a part of the New World Foundation building in Muizenberg. At the centre of the violent protest is a piece of land known as Xakabantu, which residents vowed to occupy. It is believed to belong to a neighbouring nature reserve. Goliat said residents were still adamant about the land and had vowed to occupy it until their demands were met. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

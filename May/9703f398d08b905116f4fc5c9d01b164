“Africa Month is a very important programme of the government. It’s important to emphasise the point that Africa and Africans, their duty is to unite,” Mthethwa said. May has been declared Africa Month to celebrate the founding of the Organisation of African Unity on May 25, 1963, as a symbol of unity among all Africans. Africa Month is conceptualised within the context of several policies and legislative instruments that guide what South Africa wants to achieve domestically and internationally. In this regard, the principles of the National Development Plan 2030 and Outcome 11 and 14 of the Medium-Term Strategy Framework objectives become the pillars of Africa Month. “What was started by the Organisation of African Unity should find reflection in the challenges of today, which are on a larger scale of the economy, social and cultural integration, so each programme is designed to speak to that,” Mthethwa said. At the centre of Africa Month this year is the theme “The Year of Nelson Mandela: Building a Better Africa and a Better World”. “This year is Nelson Mandela’s and maNontsikelelo Albertina Sisulu’s year. They would have turned 100 years old, so we have decided to dedicate this year to them because its their centenary,” he said. Last year’s theme focused on Oliver Tambo, who would have turned 100 Artscape director Marlene le Roux said she felt honoured that Artscape was taking part in Africa Month. “I think it is important that we promote Africa. “We need to use this particular entity to spread knowledge, and our young people need to know more about Africa,” Le Roux said. She added that this was an opportunity for students to familiarise themselves with some of Africa’s well-known figures who helped shape the continent. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Scholtz said she decided to walk next to the railway line when she came across a heap of leaves. “I moved the leaves and found Courtney lying there, with a torn bush pulled across her upper body.” Scholtz started crying and said: “I knew it was her, because her mom gave a description of the clothes she wore when she disappeared.” “The police arrived and cordoned off the scene,” she told the court. Earlier, the accused, Mortimer Saunders, pleaded guilty to murdering Courtney by giving her ant poison. At the time, Saunders was renting a room in the house where Courtney lived. @RusanaPhilander  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

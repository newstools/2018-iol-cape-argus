In Cape Town, hundreds of people, including members of the army navy and air force together with dignitaries and diplomats from countries such as Germany France and the US, came together to honour fallen heroes. “This historic event marked the end of four brutal years that claimed the lives of between 15 and 19 million people - an estimated 7 million civilians, and 10 million military personnel,” said deputy mayor Ian Neilson, at an official event held at the memorial parade cenotaph. Neilson said soldiers who died on the battlefields and in the field hospitals came from all over the world. “They represented a diverse array of nationalities, races and religions.” He said it was not only men who heeded the call of duty. “World War I saw an unprecedented mobilisation of women on all sides. "Many of them were drafted into the civilian workforce to take the place of conscripted men, and thousands served in military support roles, with some taking an active role on the battlefields.” The centenary commenced with a drill from the army, navy and air force, and rows of veterans, in sharp uniforms and bearing poppies, laid wreaths at the cenotaph.             A 93-year-old military veteran, Douglas Robertson, said he joined the army when he was 19. Robertson fought in World War II. “The war was tough. I survived through Jesus’ mercies.” Two moments of silence were observed - the first to give thanks for those who had survived, and the second honouring those who had died. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

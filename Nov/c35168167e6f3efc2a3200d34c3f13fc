Student leader Thobile Tshefu claimed the university management had initially refused to grant them permission to have a memorial service, saying they should wait until Thursday, when Sinovuyo’s death certificate and body would be released. Sinovuyo’s body was found in his student residence on Monday. Tshefu said security officers were alerted to the incident by a student who had reported a strong smell, and bloodstains were found under Sinovuyo’s door. Students and their leaders said they would leave no stone unturned to find out how Sinovuyo died, and would make sure students were kept informed about the forensic investigations. Tshefu said, there was a lot that didn’t make sense regarding Sinovuyo’s death. “Students are living in fear because no one knows what happened to their peer.” He said they would push for a full disclosure about the cause of death after investigations had been completed “We will take the family’s wishes into account because we are worried about our safety,” Tshefu said. Students reached an agreement with the institution and went ahead with their plans and hosted a memorial service on Tuesday at 2pm. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said the disagreement was resolved and counselling had been offered to all affected parties. Sinovuyo’s mother, Noziphiwo Yhusi, was distraught about her son’s death. “Sinovuyo was my first-born and his death showed me the carelessness of CPUT,” Noziphiwo said. Campus head Theresa Bock welcomed the family and said she had acceded to the students’ demand to host a memorial. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

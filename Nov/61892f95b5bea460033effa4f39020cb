“I am going to have some fun outside the public life. I have resigned as a councillor and as a member of the DA. There are plenty of reasons why I resigned but most of them are very personal reasons. “I am a private citizen now and I don’t have to answer to anyone. I took myself out of all the public life and now I am going to have some fun outside all this. I will enjoy being just an ordinary citizen,” she said. Her resignation comes weeks after nine councillors, including former mayor Patricia de Lille, resigned from the party. In 2016, Ramsey took to Facebook and slammed homeless people, and placed a condition on tolerating them in Sea Point stating that “they would have to behave in a manner which is acceptable to other residents”. Ramsay also called on her followers to stop giving to “beggars, street people and car guards” - a move she claimed would force them “to move elsewhere”. Ramsey reportedly pleaded guilty at a disciplinary committee and was fined R10000. Last month, De Lille resigned along with councillors Jonathan Cupido and Philiswa Maarman. ANC council leader Xolani Sotashe said: “The centre of this party is not holding. People are leaving left, right and centre. The council don’t have a chief whip and there is no indication from the DA as to when this critical post will be filled.” DA Cape metro leader Grant Twigg said: “Shayne Ramsay resigned and she expressed her gratitude towards the DA for the opportunity she could serve as a councillor.” argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

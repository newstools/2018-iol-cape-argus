They will be also be ceasing all after-school activities from Thursday. In a letter in possession of the Cape Argus, sent to all staff members, they said: “We require you to get all time sheets for your facilitators to us by today so salaries can be paid on November 25. “We will communicate collection thereof. Even though the centres are closed, facilitators will still be paid up to November 29 as normal. Savings, if applicable, and holiday pay will be paid on December 14.” They initially announced plans to downscale their centres. The organisation’s offices in Athlone had been severely affected by staff picketing outside. “We found out today that they have decided to close the centre, and staff are panicking. “We are not getting clear answers as to what they are planning and what will happen now,” said Elvis Sibeko, arts and culture programme co-ordinator at the foundation. The organisation said they were closing the centre in light of the recent protests. “Staff safety is our first priority. That why a decision was taken to close the office earlier. The Sybrand Park offices will be closed until further notice,” said Kevin Chaplin, managing director of the foundation. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

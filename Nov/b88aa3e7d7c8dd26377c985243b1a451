Law students Nandile Qwemesha and Emmanuel Ndumndum were in their second year and were believed to have been in a relationship with each other. Emmanuel committed suicide last Thursday and Nandile reportedly hanged herself on Tuesday. The university has confirmed that three students from the institution have died in recent days. The third student, Monde Montwana, was shot at the weekend in Delft. UWC Professor Cherrel Africa said the incidents occurred off-campus. Africa said counselling and support services were available for students via the University’s Centre for Student Support Services. Students have taken to social media to share their shock and heartbreak at the deaths, with many sharing personal anecdotes about the students. One, Khutazwa Myland, expressed her shock and said they had lost future advocates. “The institution should also provide more psychologists to help us. This is very painful. Within a week we have lost two of our students through suicide.” Another student, Zanokuhle Mayaphi, said that because of the high depression statistics of UWC students and the poor availability of psychologists on campus, depressed students were referred to expensive private psychologists or had to wait for months for a consultation. “Can’t the UWC management use post-graduate psychology students in assisting the affected students, thus giving them experience and reducing the number of students dropping out, failing and hurting themselves due to depression?” Mayaphi said. “The psychology department must use it’s post graduates to do a similar thing like the nursing department does.” sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

The development, which would have seen groundbreaking social housing as part of it, was sent back by Council. “There were very important questions made by the DA caucus. In fact, there are two important questions that Brett failed dismally to address,” said Bonginkosi Madikizela, DA provincial leader and Western Cape Human Settlements MEC. “The first was surrounding the social housing company that they were going to use, given the fact there were a number of complaints made regarding Communicare. “The second one was the feasibility of the housing units. It will cost us over R700 000 per unit, which is not feasible.” Madikizela said Herron failed to give an explanation to councillors and “threw his toys out of his cot”.             What was supposed to be a briefing regarding the Salt River development project, as well as the progress that has been made in undoing apartheid-era spatial planning and building inclusive communities, was instead used by Madikizela to launch a scathing attack on the party’s detractors, who accused them of deliberately abandoning social housing projects in the inner city. “Brett was dishonest. He lied and used this project to justify the decision he already took. You can’t blame the City’s caucus for questioning, given the fact that every project Brett is involved in had a huge question mark,” Madikizela said. Said Herron: “I know the DA and its spin machine well. I was the so-called ‘brand ambassador’. They send out scripts for ‘brand ambassadors’ to speak to and to use on social media. The DA is basically a PR machine - a total sham of a party.” Herron also said the party was giving conflicting reasons as to why the Salt River development was put on ice. “If I was lying and their reasons legitimate, we would all have expected a coherent response dismissing my claims weeks ago,” he said.                   @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

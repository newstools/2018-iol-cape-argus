According to the City’s Recreational Water Use by-law, the City may prescribe fees as per its tariff schedule as well as authorise the issuing of permits for any activity or for the use of any amenity or facility provided by the City in connection with any recreational water. The report was tabled at on Wednesday’s mayoral committee meeting and will be presented to the council next month for final adoption. In a draft report the City says some inland water bodies complement adjacent residential housing and public recreational areas with their own associated water-based activities. The by-law's purpose is to regulate the use of recreational water within the jurisdiction of the City; to control the use of vessels on inland water bodies to provide for safe and environmentally sensitive recreation; and to provide for matters incidental thereto. Resident were given the chance to comment on this by-law. Matt Weisse said: “The Milnerton Lagoon water is grey, it stinks and there are things floating that do not belong there. Parts of the wetlands are so neglected that the water cannot flow from the bulrushes. It is no use having long meetings... get hands on, and get everyone to do their bit.” Mark Smith said: “I’m against paying any fee to make use of the waterway. I pay enough rates and taxes as it is. It is just another money-making racket. And what about taking friends out on the lake who don’t have this? I’m against the ban of dogs on board vessels, I want freedom of choice on this matter.” jason.felix@inl.co.za Cape Argus

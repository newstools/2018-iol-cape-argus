Twenty-two wanted suspects, aged between 18 and 31, were arrested for crimes including murder, armed robbery, theft, malicious damage to property and assault. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the suspects, all from Hanover Park, were arrested during police patrols. “The suspects are all due to appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court.” On Saturday an intelligence-driven operation was conducted in conjunction with members of the Rapid Rail National Response Team at a house in Villa Bianco Flat, Bellville, which led to the arrest of a 31-year-old man on charges of dealing in drugs. Van Wyk said police received information about a suspected drug house and acted swiftly. “At the premises, members found a dagga laboratory, approximately 200 grams of cocaine and chemicals used manufacture drugs which they seized,” he said. The estimated value of the high grade dagga and cocaine is R900 000. In Mitchells Plain, police conducted an integrated operation focusing on crime prevention and community mobilisation in conjunction with the Mitchells Plain community policing forum, safety structures, metro police and members attached to the Base Camp and Flash (firearms, liquor control and secondhand goods). They focused on several streets and houses at which drugs and liquor were being sold illegally. Van Wyk said several foot patrols were conducted during the evening to increase police visibility within the Tafelsig and Eastridge sectors. He said the unit received information that liquor was being sold illegally at a house in Cobblestone Street. “During the search the members found hidden inside the house 52.5 litres of liquor. A 44-year-old suspect was arrested,” Van Wyk said. @SISONKE_MD sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

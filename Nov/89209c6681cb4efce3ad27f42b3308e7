Police say security guards only discovered the body of Sinovuyo Yhusi, 31 after they noticed blood seeping under his dorm door. Manenberg Police Station commander, Brigadier Enolium Joseph, says shortly after 6pm, security guards at the college called police after finding the first-year Khayelitsha student. “Police were called to the college after the student was found by security guards doing their routine patrols,” he says. “The guards noticed blood coming from a single male dorm and opened the door to see what was happening. “They found the decomposed body which had superficial cuts on the torso and was lying in a pool of blood. “It appeared that he had bled to death and had been there for several days as the body was in an advanced stage of decomposition.” Joseph says students told police they last saw Yhusi alive on Wednesday and have no idea what could have led to his death. “At this stage, it is unclear if he was murdered and it’s difficult to tell,” the top cop says. “A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death and for now detectives have opened an inquest docket and the investigation is underway. “No arrests have been made.” Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) spokesperson, Lauren Kansley, explains the nursing college campus is currently being managed by CPUT. “We confirm the passing of a first-year nursing student at our Athlone campus. SAPS are investigating the cause of death and his next-of-kin have been informed,” she says. “Counselling support will be provided to staff and students who may require it and we will remain in contact with the family as the investigation progresses.” Yhusi’s family was not available for comment.

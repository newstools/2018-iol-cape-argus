Larry Johnson and Christopher September, two of the five accused on trial for little Zahnia’s murder and the attempted murder of her father, Bradley Robyn, were convicted on Thursday. They were found guilty of the attempted murder of five others, including Zahnia’s grandfather, Peter Robyn. Johnson and his mother, Miriam Johnson - the 5th accused - were convicted of obstructing the ends of justice. Co-accused Taswill Kriel and Morné May were acquitted of all charges by Judge Robert Henney. Woodward was in high spirits. “I am happy that at least somebody is guilty of the murder, it’s not like everyone is free. The one word I was waiting for all this time was ‘guilty’. “I am grateful that we have found justice for Zahnia after fighting for her for two years.” Zahnia was killed in a gang related shooting on December 30, 2016. She was in her father’s arms when a bullet struck her in the head. Her father was hit in his lower back and buttocks. Zahnia and her father were sitting on the porch when a VW Golf drove by and shots were fired at an alleged gang leader standing on the corner of the road.

Cape Town’s Muslim community held their celebration at the Husami mosque in Cravenby, Estate, Elsies River. Men dressed in loose pants, matching jackets and wraparound belts stood in lines and semi-circles for the "dhikr", or religious invocations. Women wore hijab-style dresses. While the steady beat of a drum and the intonation of the prayers sounded, attendees were kneeling down, whipping their bodies back and front, listening to their guest Omar Dawood, who visited from Durban. Husami Masjid assistant treasurer Jamalodien Paleyer said the prophet’s birth anniversary is commemorated in the month of Rabi’ al-awwal - the third month in the Islamic calendar. “The celebration is recognised as a national holiday in a number of Muslim majority countries,” Paleyer said. “Our religion is a way of life. The mosque and Muslim houses across the world are decorated with lights for the Mawlid al-Nabi holiday in celebration of the prophet’s birth, born in the year 570 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan,” he said. Husami educare teacher and a daughter to KW Parker, an 83-year-old elder at the Husami Mosque, Mubeena Parker-Ismail said prophet Muhammad was the best man on "this earth" and lived an exemplary life. Mubeena said Moulood celebration may vary according to the country, but in general the day is observed. “We come together, pray, eat and we will march with Habibia Brigade from Khurshidul hall to hoist the Islamic flag at Husami Masjid,” she said.   sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

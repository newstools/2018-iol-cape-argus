This is just the latest coastal improvements by the City’s Park and Recreation Department. “Our tidal pools are popular spots as these shallow pools of seawater are the ideal space for families with younger children to enjoy our coast,” said JP Smith, Mayco member for safety and security; and social services. The upgrade project, worth R6.1million, included the construction of a new wall capping, the construction of a platform, the closing of old valves at the bottom of the pool and the rehabilitation of the baby pool, platform and steps at Soetwater tidal pool. Work done at Glencairn tidal pool include the demolition of the old remains of the wall, 90% of which had collapsed due to various holes in the foundations; construction of a new wall with fibre reinforced concrete; and the filling up of holes in the bedrock. Additional major projects which have been implemented on the False Bay coastline include the upgrade of the Miller’s Point recreation area, the resurfacing of the Fish Hoek walkway, the Strand sea wall and Fisherman's Lane in Strandfontein. The department has implemented a range of other projects to upgrade facilities on an ongoing basis, though some have yet to be allocated funding. "The City goes the extra mile to ensure that our beach facilities are world class, but we need the public to play their part. Some of the challenges at our beaches include vandalism and theft at facilities," said Smith. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

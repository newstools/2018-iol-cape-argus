Defence lawyers for Christopher September, Larry Johnson, Taswill Kriel and Morne May presented arguments calling for the court to grant an acquittal for the murder of Zahnia and for attempted murder of numerous alleged Ocean View JFK gang members. However, their arguments failed to convince Judge Robert Henney. He only granted the application for September, Kriel and May for defeating and obstructing the ends of justice. Advocate Mohammed Sibda, who represents Johnson’s mother Miriam Johnson, did not bring forward an application for the murder or attempted murder charges. He made an application for defeating and obstructing the ends of justice, which she faced. Judge Henney dismissed the application for both Larry and his mother for that charge. Zahnia’s mother, Cindy Woodward, was overjoyed with the ruling.   She said she was relieved that they were not set free. Zahnia was shot and murdered last January, while sitting on her father's, Bradley Robyn, arms. The shots were fired from a white VW Golf that had been driving by. The white Volkswagen Golf was only discovered at a house several days after the incident. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

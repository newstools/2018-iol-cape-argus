The Cape Law Society claimed Mlunguza “manifested character defects and lack of integrity; and has by these dishonourable actions shown himself to be unfit to continue to practise as an attorney”. On Wednesday, Judges Rosheni Allie and Mark Sher ruled in favour of the Law Society. Mlunguza was held liable for the costs of the application on an attorney and client scale. The Law Society brought the application to the court following nine complaints, over a period of five years, from clients who claimed the attorney had been taking money from them without an agreement to do so. At the time the application was brought to the high court’s attention, Mlunguza had already been practising in Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape. His legal fees were beyond excessive. It is alleged he charged clients R4000 and R8000 for postage and collecting letters, as well as R3254 for a call and R8000 for a consultation. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus

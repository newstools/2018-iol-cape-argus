EE released a report investigating implementing agents (IA's) in charge of building schools and the report showed that underspending and mismanagement by contractors was largely responsible for basic Norms and Standards for Public School Infrastructure standards not being achieved. “Public money meant for school construction is siphoned to professional fees of third-party consultants, while teachers and learners languish in crisis conditions. “Departments of Education are not alone in perpetuating a pattern of outsourcing services. In the post 1994 era, a major innovation in SA governance was the contracting out of core government functions,” said Equal Education researcher, Nika Soon-Shiong. Soon-Shiong said although the case of outsourcing work to IA’s doesn’t apply to the Western Cape who has largely adhered to the NSPSI, the department was still behind on addressing inadequate school buildings. Soon-Shiong said irregular expenditure and the inclusion of poor performing contractors into the department's database resulted in inadequate school buildings. Soon-Shiong said poor performing contractors are added to a database of restricted suppliers and no one is ever added to the delinquent supplier database. In the WCED progress report, 98 inappropriate school structures were identified to be replaced. While 42 of the structures have been addressed, the department can only preparing for the completion of all these schools by 2027. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

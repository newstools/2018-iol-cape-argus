The new seabird hospital and facility was opened on Wednesday. The hospital is the largest seabird hospital in southern Africa. Sanccob is also celebrating its 50th birthday. Chairperson Marietta Hopley said: “We have done a major renovation of the facility that was here. We have upgraded the old building and built new pools and hospital facilities. It’s an absolutely phenomenal milestone for us. We are proud of this moment and we are thankful to everybody who has contributed to this. “The reconstructed hospital was in line with what was needed and it came about because of fundraising and the participation of the general public and organisations.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The hospital includes two ICUs, a three-part wash bay area for oiled birds, two surgery rooms, an X-ray room, an aviary for flying birds, a pen, a pool for penguins and a water filtration tank area. The facility will offer group tours and is wheelchair-friendly. Chief executive Stephen van der Spuy said: “The new hospital will be much easier to work with and much easier for the rehabilitation to be done. I had a dedicated team to make sure we got through all of this. The new centre will be enlightening for the public and it is amazing to see the seabirds up close and to be able to see how the professionals work with the animals.” sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus

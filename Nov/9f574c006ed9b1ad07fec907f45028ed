Gift of the Givers donated 850 stationery packs, hand sanitiser bottles and bottled water. The pupils’ spirits were raised when they saw the Cape Town City FC players enter their hall, and they cheered at the top of their lungs for their favourite team. A few pupils received the opportunity to meet some of the players on the hall’s stage and have their photographs taken with them. The players’ visit and the donations were appreciated by teachers, as 12 pupils were left without homes, valuables, stationery and uniforms after the fires. “We are grateful to come here and encourage the kids, to let them know that they are one of us. Some of our players also come from this community, and it gives us a good feeling to come and support this community, because they are always giving us support,” said Thamsanqa Mkhize, captain of Cape Town City. Ali Sablay, Gift of the Givers project manager in the Western Cape, said: “Some of the learners are writing examinations and they lost everything during the fires, especially all their studying material, and we thought that the best thing to do for them during this time, to help push up their spirits, was to bring the Cape Town City team players here, as they are role models for the youth and it was nice to see the reaction from the learners.”       He said the fires had led to water shortages in the Khayelitsha area and the bottles of donated water would help towards pupils having sufficient water at school. Bongani Mfikili, principal, thanked the team and Gift of the Givers. “The visit by the Gift of the Givers and the Cape Town City team has made a difference towards the vision of these learners. We are very happy that our school has received this support.” Thembelihle High School is the first in the area to be assisted by Gift of the Givers after the fires. The organisation plans to donate items to other schools there. @Sukainaish  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

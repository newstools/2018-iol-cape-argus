"They can, however, not afford the high tariffs that the City charges us. That is where the problem lies. The City simply doesn’t want to listen to its ratepayers," Dickson said. Secretary of the Greater Cape Town Civic Alliance, Philip Bam, said: “So the City of Cape Town is relaxing water restrictions. Good. "But what we need more than relaxing of restrictions is relaxing of the ridiculously exorbitant water charges and levies.” ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said more financial relief from the punitive tariffs would have been more prudent. “The drought levy needs to be scrapped. The water tariffs need to be reduced to R4 per kilolitre and stop charging people for the blue water meters,” he said. Asked whether the City’s finances would be impacted by the lowering of tariffs, Neilson said: “There has been over-recovery amounts for the last few months. "That also gives us some space to work with. But in essence we know that there is likely to be an increase in water usage. So this will mean that we sell more water. So everything balances out.” Mayoral committee member for water, sanitation and informal settlements Xanthea Limberg said they were following a conservative approach in the light of rainfall uncertainty over the coming two years. “These Level 3 recovery restrictions are also a measure to help support the great change we have seen in the relationship that we have with water while, at the same time, providing some financial relief to residents and businesses,” she said. Cape Chamber of Commerce president Janine Myburgh welcomed the relaxation of water restrictions. jason.felix@inl.co.za Cape Argus

This was the message from Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde on Monday, when he visited the Hanover Park home of Peace Ambassador Samuels, 17, who was shot four times two months ago. Winde shared a table and drank coffee with Riedwaan, his grandparents, Shafiek Samuels and Faghmieda Samuels, and his uncle, Ridwan Hoosen, discussing ways to fight gangsterism and drug abuse in Hanover Park. Winde said he was going to use every tool at his disposal to improve safety for the people of the Western Cape. “This includes embracing technology in the fight against crime, and strengthening partnerships between all relevant safety stakeholders in our region - police, neighbourhood watches, community policing forums, street committees and units like the peace ambassadors. “I remain committed to working with communities to address gangsterism in their areas. I will not give up.” The Grade 12 pupil from Groenvlei High School said that after matric he wanted to be a lawyer to identify legal issues that must be addressed. Riedwaan, whose leg is still in a cast, said when he went back to school he would tell his story and encourage other learners to join the Peace Ambassador group. “I do not understand people who would waste their time in gangsterism. People must value their time and use it wisely." @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

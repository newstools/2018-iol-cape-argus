This is according to State advocate Louis van Niekerk, who argued before Western Cape High Court Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe for the former property mogul to be convicted of murder. Jason’s wife, Susan Rohde, was found dead in a locked bathroom in a room she shared with Jason on July 24, 2016, at the Spier Wine Estate Hotel. She was found with an electronic cord wrapped around her neck. The cord had been tied to the hook of the bathroom door. It is the State’s case that she was murdered by her husband, but the defence argues that it was suicide. The court heard that leading to the death, Jason and his wife’s marriage had been under strain. “This is not the first time that the two of them went at each other like this At some stage in the room they were arguing, and he snapped. He wanted her to shut up. “Whether she was smothered or he took his hand in her neck to cause her to die. She is now dead; he panicked,” said Van Niekerk. Arguments continue today. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

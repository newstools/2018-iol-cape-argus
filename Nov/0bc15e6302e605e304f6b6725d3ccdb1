Cape Town - AfriForum is taking Parliament to court on Thursday to ask that the Constitutional Review Committee's report on the expropriation of land without compensation be blocked. The legal battle had led Parliament to postpone the debate and vote on the report by the National Assembly on Tuesday this week to next week Tuesday. At the heart of the argument by AfriForum in the Western Cape High Court is that the process followed by the Constitutional Review Committee was flawed. The lobby group has argued that the written submissions were not considered by the committee. More than 700 000 written submissions were received by Parliament, but not all of them were considered. Other opposition parties had also argued in the committee that the ANC and EFF were making a procedural error by refusing to consider the written submissions before voting on the report. AfriForum now wants the High Court to stop the process that would allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Parliament has opposed the application by AfriForum saying it was ill-advised. A full bench of the Western Cape High Court will hear the application. Political Bureau

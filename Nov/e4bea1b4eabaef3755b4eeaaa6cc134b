The Cape Hindu, also known as the Siva Aalayam, also celebrated 40 years of the community. Siva Aalayam chairperson Gabs Pather said the Aalayam community had evolved over the years from serving and focusing on the local community in Rylands to becoming a universal centre for religious, cultural and community activity, while retaining its emphasis on the promotion of the Tamil language and culture. Pather said the opening of their new temple would help take their legacy forward. “We reflect on the past, look to the future and aim to further promote Hinduism, the Tamil language, culture and heritage.” Pather said they would also take a closer look at the values inspired by Nelson Mandela and how they corresponded with the principles of Hinduism. Participants and attendees carried the kavadi, a flower-decorated arch, to honour the temple, and there was dancing and music. Siva Aalayam’s officiating priest, Guru Krishna, said November 19 marked the 40th anniversary of the Siva Aalayam Temple - officially opened in 1978 by Amma Thirunagavalli Dixon Pillay. Krishna said he was “very blessed” to be part of the Sri Siva Aalayam since 1990. “I am looking forward to the new temple project which will transform the entire temple to a typical South Indian temple, with the blend of South Indian architecture.” “I call upon all the youth and people of the Western Cape to join hands to embark on this once-in-a-life-time opportunity to be part of the new temple project,” Krishna said. He urged people to use the Aalayam temple for the search of “spiritual truth and values of life” through regular presence. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

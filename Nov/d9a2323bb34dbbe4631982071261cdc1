The 44km ride began at 6.30am at the Fish Hoek beach parking area and ended where Botha lost his life. A vehicle had crashed into members of the 5F Cycling Club, who were practising, in the cyclists’ lane, for the upcoming Coronation DC event. A few of the other riders were injured. The Pedal Power Association (PPA) also placed a “ghost bike” at the site, in remembrance of Botha. This is a memorial placed where a cyclist has been killed or severely injured. Robert Vogel, PPA chief executive, said: “Cyclists are no longer safe and motorists treat them with the most blatant disregard.” He added that Botha was the second member to have been killed this year: “There were over 14 000 road fatalities last year and this is not the concern of cyclists only; it’s a general safety concern (about) our roads.” PPA member Ian McPherson, 68, was killed near Fish Hoek in March, when he was stabbed and robbed of his bicycle and cellphone. Three suspects were arrested. “We want to see a fluid justice system so that cyclists do not have to live in constant fear. The city and provincial government must create a safer environment,” Vogel said. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

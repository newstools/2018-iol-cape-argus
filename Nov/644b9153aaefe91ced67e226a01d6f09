The department said the foundation was non-compliant for a number of reasons. According to the department, Amy Foundation’s registration expired in December last year. For this reason, the department is no longer funding the foundation. The Early Learning Resource Unit, a contracted social service provider assisting with the administrative process of registration, received all outstanding documents on November 6 for re-registration and is expected to conduct a site visit very soon. Last week, The Cape Argus reported on workers at the Foundation’s Athlone offices protesting to have the foundation audited. They claimed to have been subjected to unfair labour practices. “While the Amy Foundation remains non-compliant, this department is doing its utmost to assist this organisation in becoming compliant by adhering to all of the requirements,” said Social development MEC Albert Fritz. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

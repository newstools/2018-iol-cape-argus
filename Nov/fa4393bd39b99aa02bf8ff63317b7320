Cape Town - Fuming Bo-Kaap residents who managed to stop a crane from entering the highly contested Lions Street development, are outraged over the way the city council’s law enforcement officers treated residents following a scuffle on Tuesday. “We are not going to stop. We were not scared away. We resisted the situation and we stopped the crane from coming in,” said Fouzia Achmat, vice-chairperson of the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers’ Association. On Tuesday chaos erupted as Bo-Kaap residents and the police clashed over the recent developments in the area. The police had to use teargas to keep protesters at bay. The Muslim Judicial Council has lashed out at the law enforcement and the police for their “blatant display of brutality toward the elderly residents of Bo-Kaap”. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said: “I have asked for someone to submit a complaint to the executive director so that we may investigate any allegations against city (council) staff. “Staff were legally obligated to act on a court interdict and when metro police staff are at the scene of public violence they operate under instruction from SAPS.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

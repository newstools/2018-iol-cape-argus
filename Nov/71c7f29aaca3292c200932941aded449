The city wants to repeal the Constitution of the Transport for Cape Town by-law, 2013, and the Constitution of the Transport and Urban Development Authority (TDA) by-law, 2016. TDA, led by former mayco member Brett Herron, is responsible for transport, housing and other urban infrastructure. De Lille and Herron based the TDA’s vision on building houses and other infrastructure close to major transport routes. But Mayor Dan Plato said the intention is to amend the city’s governance structure, based on and informed by the lessons learnt over the past two years. “The proposal to repeal the two by-laws is one step in facilitating this process, which is needed to improve service delivery,” he said. Plato said it would be pre-emptive to speculate on any new structure as the prescribed statutory process related to the decision is ongoing. Furthermore, the by-laws can only be repealed through a decision by Council. When residents asked if the city’s plans for more progressive housing opportunities were still on the cards, Plato said the city had adopted progressive policies to address the legacy of apartheid spatial planning. “(Also) to provide housing on land close to work opportunities and public transport, and to spend the bulk of its capital budget in areas where the public money will benefit the most people,” he said. The public has until December 11 to comment. jason.felix@inl.co.za Cape Argus

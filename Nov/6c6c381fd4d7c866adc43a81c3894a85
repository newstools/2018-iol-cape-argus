Willie Simons, 34, entered a plea and sentence agreement whereby he admitted to raping Zakeera Hendricks and strangling her on February 27, 2016, in a wendy house in Verster Street. At the time of the incident, Zakeera was left in Simons’ care. Her mother, Zaida Hendricks, was out attending a dance party celebrating her boyfriend’s birthday. Zaida left the child at around 11.30pm that night. She found the child’s dead body the following day at 10am, tucked in bed and covered with a blanket. In his plea, read out by his lawyer advocate Michael Sebueng, Simon pleaded guilty to the charges he faced. Western Cape High Court Acting Judge Murray Bridgman asked Simons to confirm that he voluntarily made the plea, to which Simons agreed. The acting judge convicted Simons on both charges. The case was postponed to December 10 for sentencing. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

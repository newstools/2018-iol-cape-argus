The built environment and landscape committee of Heritage Western Cape was supposed to make a decision on Wednesday on whether to demolish the iconic building and build a high-rise apartment block. “Because the building is older than 60 years, a demolition permit is required in terms of Section 34 of the National Heritage Resources Act. “The owner has applied for such a permit,” said Rodger van Wyk, one of the owners of Deer Park Café. “Neither the building’s owner nor the developer engaged the restaurants in advance of the demolition application, and no long-term arrangements have been made with any of the current restaurant operators in relation to their tenure after the demolition. “No arrangements have been mooted or put in place for the preservation of Rocklands Park, which adjoins Deer Park Café,” he said. Concerned residents from city suburbs including Zonnebloem, Vredehoek, Sea Point, Gardens, Woodstock, Orangezicht and Devil’s Peak, the current operators of Deer Park Café, and the Friends of Rocklands Park have opposed the demolition. Greater Vredehoek Heritage Action Group chairperson Charl de Villers said: “As a group we are playing a supportive role especially for the restaurant owners who are very concerned and anxious about this.” A notice was issued in September about plans to demolish the building. The property houses three restaurants and a supermarket. It is a provincial heritage building. This latest encroachment by developers comes after Bo-Kaap residents fought off a developer to protect the heritage of their suburb. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

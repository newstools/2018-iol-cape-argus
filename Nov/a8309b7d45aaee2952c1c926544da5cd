Sapu general secretary Tumelo Mogodiseng said police management “finally” requested a meeting with the union for December 6. “We are not against the rolling of the AGU, but the SA police misled the people.” He said police called a specialised task team a “unit”. “If they call it a unit why didn’t they consult relevant stake holders before the establishment as per the agreement. We are not opposing the idea, but they must follow the rules of engagement.” He said that according to the agreement the union must be consulted before any adjustments are made to police structures, even though Deputy National Police Commissioner Bonang Mgwenya said it was not a different unit, police made several references to an AGU. Mogodiseng said that in terms of section 205(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 108 of 1996, the objectives of the SA Police Service were to, prevent, combat and investigate crime, maintain public order; protect and secure the inhabitants of the republic and their property; and uphold and enforce the law. “The Safety and Security Sectoral Bargaining Council Agreement 2 of 2009, paragraph 4.4(d) prescribes that changes in the organisation of work must be consulted with the admitted trade unions.” The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union spokesperson Richard Mamabolo said: “This takes us back to the working conditions of our members. We want to know if our members are protected, what kind of work are they doing and will there be improvements in their salaries.” Parliament’s portfolio committee and standing committee for community safety is currently receiving a briefing from the police.      sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus

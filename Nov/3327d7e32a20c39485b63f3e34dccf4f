The students - who are from various communities across the province, including Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain, Hanover Park and Worcester - formed part of the female course, which saw 190 students being trained to deal with safety in communities. The graduates who completed the three-month course will now be given a 12-month career opportunity and five years of after-care support as part of the Department of Community Safety initiative to further develop and support the graduates so they can reach their full potential. “The purpose of the Chrysalis Academy is to serve as a platform for youth to deepen their resilience and unleash their potential through physical, mental, emotional and spiritual development, enabling them to be role models and agents of positive change. “The graduates should be proud of completing the three-month-long programme. They have a responsibility to use their acquired knowledge and skills to continue uplifting themselves and their communities,” said Minister of Community Safety Alan Winde. Winde said the Department of Community Safety has remained the main funder and donor of the Chrysalis programme since its inception in 1999 and gave R13 million towards the foundation, which was established as a response to the high crime rate in the Western Cape. The graduates will now be placed at municipalities, hospitals, clinics and community improvement districts across the province to serve and protect. They also performed community services in Lavender Hill and Westlake and were exposed to computer training and women's health training, while many donated blood for the first time. “I want to encourage all graduates to be positive role models in their communities, as our province needs everyone's active participation, particularly that of the country's youth, to ensure a safer province. “The Chrysalis graduates have an excellent opportunity to now contribute to creating a safer Western Cape.” argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

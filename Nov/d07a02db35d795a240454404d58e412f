Andrew believes the cadet force combined with schools and communities could bring a major improvement in communities affected by gang violence. “This project promotes and supports the role of young people in peace-building and disciplinary activities that contribute to living together in dignity and dialogue,” Andrew said. More than 14 pupils in Uitsig were awarded and certified for being part of the generation cadets, Andrew said. He and his wife started the cadet initiative in 2014. “We want the future of our children in Uitsig to be better and not to think and be stressed about joining gangs,” Andrew said. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

If you still need to collect your gear, your last chance to do so will be today between 9am and 5pm at the pick-up point at Green Point Track at 11 Fritz Sonnenberg Road, Green Point. All registered runners must collect their participation packs (which include the official 2018 event shirt, headband, powder, temporary tattoo, race number and more) before the event. Tomorrow, festivities are set to kick off at 9am at the festival zone at Sea Point Promenade. “There is something always going on. There’s entertainment along the whole route and at the festival zone at the end (of the run),” said organiser and marketing manager for Sport Vendo James Bell. “(The event is) completely family-friendly, so no alcohol is involved, and the powder (with which participants colour themselves) is made from organic corn starch, so it’s not painful or harmful. It’s loads of entertainment and from a parent-perspective, it’s a fun way to get the kids out and doing exercise.” All runners should get ready in the start chute at 2.45pm, as the starting gun goes off at 3pm. Runners take off in batches of approximately 500 three minutes apart. It takes between one and two hours to run or walk to the end of the route. At the festival zone there will be food and drink, best-dressed competitions, and DJs and local acts will provide music and entertainment. A limited number of tickets are still available and they are going fast. To enter, visit https://thecolorrun.co.za/locations/cape-town/ for more info. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

NGO Ilitha Labantu, with the Khayelitsha Site B Police and various organisations, started the proceedings with a march from Site B police station, mobilising and distributing pamphlets and posters that encouraged victims of domestic violence and women and child abuse to speak out and educate residents about violence. Ilitha Labantu spokesperson Siyabulela Monakali said the #OneToo­ManySA campaign was established as a response to the violence perpetrated on women and children in the area. Monakali said violence against women and children in Khayelitsha has reached pandemic rates, with an increase each week in the number of kidnappings, rapes and murders of women and children. “Ilitha Labantu strongly believes that it is only through a collective effort that we are able to effectively address the scourge that is plaguing our homes and community. “We are here to address the issues in our communities. We are trying to make people think critically about violence against women and children,” Monakali said. He added that they wanted to break the silence. “This motorcade wants to address issues that people do not want to talk about.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

We have to take a stand,” Nyanda said. Another resident, Nozuko Mekuto said: “Enough is enough. Abusers must be sent to jail. They have no place in our society.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

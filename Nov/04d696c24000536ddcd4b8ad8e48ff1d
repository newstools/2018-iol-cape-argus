Cape Town - The Hawks’ Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) has added three other suspects as part of the ongoing efforts to clamp down on drugs in the Western Cape. Two weeks ago a Hawks and Crime Intelligence operation led to the arrest of Mogamat Rafiek Hayners (24) and the recovery of various drugs ranging from heroin, tik and mandrax valued at more than R8.9 million allegedly concealed at a storage facility in Somerset West earlier this month. The three Russel Stanton Jonathan (53), Mark Overmeyer (51) and Zaynisa Alfoz (45) were apprehended in various parts of Cape Town for their alleged involvement on the drugs seized at the storage facility. Jonathan was arrested on Monday at his residence in Hanover Park for his alleged involvement, whilst Alfoz was apprehended last week Tuesday. Overmeyer was traced and arrested last week Wednesday with the assistance of the Western Cape Anti-Gang Unit. All three suspects have already appeared at the Somerset West Magistrate court on Tuesday, last week Thursday and Friday respectively.  Jonathan, Alfoz and Overmeyer have all been remanded in custody and will join Hayners at the Somerset West Magistrate Court tomorrow in their bid to get bail. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

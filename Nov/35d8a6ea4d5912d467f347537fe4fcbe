Phillips, who had remained tight-lipped, told the court on Thursday about the love he and his now-dead girlfriend, Sharisha Chauhan, had shared. “Our love was so deep that the ocean would be jealous. Sharisha and I initiated a strong connection from the beginning. Words can’t describe the connection we had. We discussed future plans of living together, tying the knot as soon as she completed her studies,” he said. Phillips also told the court about his difficulty in holding down a job due to news reports. “In the first three weeks of the trial I was working night shift at Eskom to attend court in the morning. I was on contract. It became tricky when sensationalism began with tabloid reports. “Everyone expressed their opinion and it (the trial) became a topic of discussion. It was then decided the contract would not be renewed.” Phillips said he did odd jobs to pay a R4 100 joint-bond and vehicle payment of R2 600 a month. Chauhan died at midnight on January 1, 2014, after attending rave party in Le Bac Estate in Paarl. It is alleged that at around midnight, Phillips, Chauhan and some friends took LSD, commonly known as acid and ecstasy. An autopsy report showed she had been vaginally and anally raped. The court found Phillips guilty of the two rape charges but acquitted him of murder. Earlier, his psychologist Dr Sherin Bickrum, said Phillips was remorseful. She said during his session he appeared broken and helpless. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus

Ferreira was president of Maties Rugby club for two terms. Rugby sport manager Quintin van Rooyen expressed the club’s appreciation to Ferreira, and said, he served with incredible devotion and passion. He said that Maties not only won the Varsity Cup this year, but also managed a historic double with the Maties Young Guns (O.20 team) winning the tournament for the first time. Newly appointed president Karaan thanked Maties rugby fraternity for their support. Van Rooyen said Karaan’s academic knowledge and work relations would be to Maties Rugby’s advantage. “We are constantly working to encourage young rugby players to focus on their academic progress which is very important for the future.” Karaan is a former dean of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at Stellenbosch University, and was acting vice-rector in 2015. He said he never played for Maties, but had met the legendary “Doc”, Danie Craven. “I am well aware of the incredible history of the club. I look forward to the new challenge and can assure you that I will do my best to make a difference at the Maties Rugby Club,” Karaan said. University chief operating officer, Professor Stan du Plessis, welcomed Karaan’s election as president of the club and said Karaan not only played a “prominent role” in South African society, he was also a leading academic and researcher who studied at the university at undergraduate and postgraduate level. “He has qualities that will see him make a huge and unique contribution to the Rugby Club.” Maties Sports chief director Ilhaam Groenewald said the election of Karaan happened during the centenary year of the university. “As the first black president of the Maties Rugby Club, marks the institution, Maties Sports and the club’s commitment to change.” She said the role of leadership was the most important ingredient to transform any organisation. “Karaan is an experienced academic, leader and mentor in various spheres.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

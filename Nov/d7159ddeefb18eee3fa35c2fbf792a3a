The foundation was started in 2011 by Paul Steyn, an amputee, and raises funds to purchase prosthetic limbs for disadvantaged amputees. Steyn’s journey as an amputee began at the age of 13 when his right leg was amputated after an accident that occurred on school premises in February 2000. His leg was caught in the blades of a lawnmower pulled behind a tractor. Doctors tried to save the leg, but after gangrene set in after nearly six months in hospital, it was decided to amputate the leg below the knee. Steyn’s accident turned his life around for the better, allowing him to achieve major things. He was recognised by the Mail & Guardian as one of the 200 most influential movers and shakers under 35 this year. His recent success includes walking 12 000km. The journey began in Pretoria on June 26 and stretched over three months. Accompanied by his fellow amputee Mike Minnie, the pair walked from Pretoria to Mbombela and on to Durban, as well as to Jeffreys Bay. Two more amputees are set to enter the process in the new year. The foundation receives about two applications for assistance per week.

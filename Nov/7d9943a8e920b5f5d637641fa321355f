“There was no agreement or deal that was struck,” said director and vice-chair Mujahid Hartley. BKYM chairperson Adnaan Oesman said: “We can truthfully say that we did not receive any funds from anyone. We have not made any decision on behalf of this community nor did we sign any deal with the building of the development. "The only agreement we have is that we have peaceful agreement going forward.” Blok’s lawyers confirmed they had been in engagement with BKYM. Two weeks ago, law firm Norton Rose Fulbright said that it recognised BKYM as a partner.      This left the Bo-Kaap Civic Association baffled, dismissing the agreements between BLok and BKYM as “invalid”. Blok spokesperson Colin Wardle said: “The only agreement Blok and BKYM have is that we want to work together to de-escalate the violence and to try find a solution through communication. Blok has not financially supported BKYM.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

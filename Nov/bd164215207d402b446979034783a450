Law firm Norton Rose Fulbright said in a statement, following a Cape Argus report this week about BKYM’s agreement with Blok, that they recognised the group as a partner. This has left the Bo-Kaap Civic Association baffled, with its secretary Jacky Poking dismissing any agreements Blok makes with BKYM as “invalid”. Blok this week obtained an interdict against Bo-Kaap residents to protect its building site on Lion Street. The civic association has challenge Blok’s development saying it destroys the area’s heritage. BKYM on the other hand has worked with Blok to ensure its development goes ahead. It has signed an agreement with it to ensure cranes are delivered to the construction site. Norton Rose said in a statement this week said that BKYM has “found potential to create opportunities for investment and growth in the Bo-Kaap community”. Referring to the group’s initial tyre-burning protests earlier this year, the law firm said the group has “changed their purpose from one of resistance, ‘to exist is to resist’, to one of social upliftment and regeneration”. But Poking lambasted BKYM, saying it was “not legitimate” and did not “represent our community”. In a previous interview with Cape Argus, BKYM chairperson Adnaan Oesman said they wanted to “find a way that our community can benefit from it (developers). At the end of the day these buildings will go up and our people will still be crying”. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus

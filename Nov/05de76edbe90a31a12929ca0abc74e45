This comes after workers at the foundation’s Athlone offices protested to have the foundation audited. “This has been going on for years and years and we just made up our minds that enough is enough. We want the CEO to listen to us. We are not violent here. The Amy Foundation is our home and we all want fair treatment,” said Elvis Sibeko, arts and culture programme co-ordinator at the foundation. He said workers at the centre received retrenchment letters without following the proper procedures. “The CEO spoke to the Cape Argus and he didn’t tell them he is busy retrenching workers unfairly and is busy closing the centres because of the Department of Social Development not providing funding. That’s wrong the department said we are not compliant because of Kevin and his board,” Sibeko said. Workers urgently wanted the company to be audited. The chief executive of the Amy Foundation, Kevin Chaplin, said: “The accusations lodged by these employees are false. The company is seeking legal recourse to resolve the issues.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus

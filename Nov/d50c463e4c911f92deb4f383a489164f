Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa has insisted there will be no land grabs in the country and assured investors the expropriation of land without compensation will be done within the confines of the law. Ramaphosa said South Africa was governed by the rule of law and land grabs will not be allowed. “Our country is based on a rule of law. We have got strong institutions that don’t only protect investors, but people,” said Ramaphosa. He said the people have turned to the courts each time they wanted to take on the government. “Land reform is conducted through the most judicious manner in our structures including Parliament,” said Ramaphosa. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is in the country on a state visit, told Ramaphosa on Tuesday that South Africa would remain attractive to investors. He said he will encourage more German companies to invest in South Africa. Steinmeier said there were currently more than 500 German companies in South Africa and they employ more than 100 000 people. The Constitutional Review Committee in Parliament last week adopted the report on the expropriation of land without compensation. The report will be debated in the Chamber next week. But opposition parties have promised to challenge the report in court. They have argued the process followed did not follow all procedures required including dealing with the 700 000 written submissions. Political Bureau

Harold Cressy High School principal Khalied Isaacs said matrics who wrote their last paper this year would come to school in casual clothes and donate their uniforms to incoming pupils who may not be able to afford a new set. “It works well. When the new Grade 8s come in, we also request a deposit from them and they get a bag with a jersey, a tie and writing books, if they pay the deposit, which is about quarter of their school fees. “We also have a sandwich feeding scheme and make sandwiches everyday. We do it discreetly and don’t embarrass pupils and address those with a uniform, nutrition or transport problem.” Athenkosi Nzala, who founded AfrikaCan Foundation, said the organisation, which works at assisting schools in Langa, identified pupils at Siyabulela Primary School in need of financial assistance for their high school fees. The organisation has committed to funding three pupils for the next five years. “(One of the pupil’s we helped) was a top performer in Grade 7, we hope that helping her will inspire her to do better, knowing that someone else is willing to fund her. She comes from Langa, an area with lots of crime. “It’s a great relief for her parents who cried and we’re hoping that she’s exposed to all activities AfrikaCan does.” Nzala said there were shortcomings when it came to basic needs among pupils at schools in areas such as Langa and Khayelitsha. Sinethemba Secondary School principal Nelson Poopedi agreed. Poopedi said the school was pleading with parents to try assist pupils with their basic stationery needs. “One of the things we’re struggling with is currently parents know it’s a no-fee school and they expect everything from government and we know it’s difficult. “We need to buy stationary for pupils, but we can’t afford that. “Cleaning materials prices increased and text books have increased with the food price increase, this indirectly affects the little amount of money we have.” athina.may@inl.co.za Cape Argus

 "I will be launching a new political party which will be contesting the 2019 elections in all provinces." - Patricia de Lille pic.twitter.com/RUmXplGu4J   Nobody benefits but Patricia De Lille. Either, she strikes a deal with the ANC, dependent on results in the WC (Premier), or she wins enough votes to get a seat in Parliament. Always been about positions; she will go wherever the money is.   I want to be excited about Patricia de Lille’s new political party but what if history repeats itself and she sells out votes to those people who don’t want us near ‘their’ beaches? Can we trust Aunty Pat with our votes?   People dismissive of Aunty Pat's new political movement, likening her to Khoza, Mamphele and other failed politicians, actually forget who Patricia De Lille is, she has been here before, an activist and has been for decades, she knows & understands exactly what she's doing   Hai Aunty Pat is too old for this drama. Citing inspiration from Madida & his former wife is laughable to say the least 😩. From the thousands she consulted from no one cared to tell her the ineffectiveness of forming a new party from a premise of anger. Why not join EFF? pic.twitter.com/3wmfwwZDpA   I think Patricia De Lille should lobby all the liberated women in politics. The likes off Makhosi Khoza, Vytjie Mentor, Thuli Madonsela etc... They can be a force to be reckoned with.   Take that Coloured vote away from the DA wena Aunty Pat. Do the Lord’s work.   Aunty Pat leaving with the DA’s colored voters 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/DToDw9J9hA   darling, i love aunty pat, truly i do. i was with her once. then riding on my vote, she decided to join the da. i won't make the same mistake twice 💅🏽 https://t.co/fiNpa4VLc3   This is cute DA been hating poc since forever have you seen the way working class coloured and black ppl are living in the Western Cape have you Aunty Pat hmm https://t.co/Suq1DF6c7H  If Patricia De Lille doesn't call her party the "New Independent Democrats" with the slogan "New ID, Same Aunty!" she's wasting everyone's time.

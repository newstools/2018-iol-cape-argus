The project will be phased in over two financial years and the budget will be used to improve infrastructure and operational management of the site. City spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said the upgrade, together with the major upgrade of the City Hall, would increase the precinct’s attraction as an events venue. “The precinct is one of our oldest and most central public spaces, with a rich history that resonates with Capetonians as well as visitors to our city and has been host to many nationally and internationally important events. “The proposed plan is to also upgrade the kiosks to fit-in with the new revamped overall aesthetics. The kiosks are non-compliant in terms of health and fire regulations,” Tyhalibongo said. These kiosks were built in the 1980s. The upgrade will include demolishing the row of small kiosks and ablution facilities. The project will upgrade the existing ablution facilities on site and complete the approved Phase 2 paving as partially implemented for the 2010 Fifa World Cup. Work is set to commence in the current financial year subject to the approval of building plans. @JasonFelix  jason,felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The State highlighted Rohde’s alleged litany of lies in support of his narrative of what happened on July 24, 2016. Prosecutor Louis van Niekerk pointed out to the Western Cape High Court various instances where it appeared that Rohde had lied. WATCH: Rohde demonstrates how he moved his wife after an argument He sighted improbabilities in Rohde’s version that his wife had locked [herself in] and hanged herself behind the bathroom door with a power cord after she discovered he had been continuing his extramarital affair with an employee, Jolene Alterskye. Rohde had told the court the cord was wrapped tight around Susan’s neck, and must’ve had a knot. “This is all a lie. The strange thing is, in your mind you 100 percent said you were not lying. Like you did all along with Susan when you said to her you have ended it with Jolene. When you are caught in a tight spot you form a lie,” said Van Niekerk. The prosecutor also pointed to the lie Rohde had told Susan’s family about the physical and verbal fight they had had hours before her death. When confronted by Susan’s family, and in a police statement, Rohde said they had had a disagreement. Van Niekerk also highlighted contrasts in Rohde’s version of events compared to maintenance man, Desmond Daniels, who helped unlock the bathroom door and was the one who removed the cord off Susan. Van Niekerk said Rohde’s version did not make sense. He said there were no bruise marks on Susan’s neck despite her being described as a person who bruised easily. The trial continues today. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

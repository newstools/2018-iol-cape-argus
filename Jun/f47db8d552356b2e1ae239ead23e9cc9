Gwala will travel to the island on Wednesday, with the aim of accompanying Jansen and Myaka on Thursday’s session. The competitive triathlete was subjected to a vicious assault in March, when three assailants tried to cut off his legs. Doctors were able to save both legs after extensive surgery. Recovery to full strength is still a long way off for the 26-year old, but participation in the Robben Island charity event is a positive sign for Gwala’s athletic future. The 27-Day Challenge sees Jansen and Myaka embark on an astounding 4666.4km of running and cycling, and Gwala is one of many famous faces who are heading over to the island to support the cause. The Takla Foundation, the charity behind the event, are aiming to raise R5 million for disadvantaged communities across the country. After hearing about the gruelling ordeal, Gwala was determined to contribute, even though he only resumed training three weeks ago. Jansen and Myaka will remain on the island until July18, which coincides with Nelson Mandela’s centenary celebrations. Members of the public can support the event through donations.

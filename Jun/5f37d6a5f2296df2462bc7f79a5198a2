The Mandela 1 Million T-Shirt Campaign was launched at TCI Apparel Design Centre in Cape Town. Ten designers, in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation and Trade Call Investments Apparel, the manufacturers, were selected to create designs. The T-shirts depict an image of Mandela and 240 words associated with his vision, wisdom and legacy. Luzuko Koti, communications director of the foundation, said the campaign brings change to society and inspires change. “We are proud we had the 1 million T-shirts made here, creating jobs and supporting families,” said Koti. “The foundation is also committed to ensuring that we do not only have 1 million shirts worn across the world, but we have 1 million people and more sharing the values of peace, humility, inclusivity that characterise our struggle for emancipation.” The cotton for the T-shirts is grown in Malawi, Madagascar, Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique. Mayor Patricia de Lille said she was honoured to be part of the launch. “It is great to know that many Cape Town residents in the clothing and textile industry are involved in making these T-shirts which bear the values Mandela lived by.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

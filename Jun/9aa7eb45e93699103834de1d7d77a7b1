There is an NGO called UTurn, based in Claremont, who believe in life after homelessness. They operate two clothing shops in the central city where one can buy second-hand clothing. It is here that I met Bianca Rabbaney, the supervisor of the Long Street branch. Bianca is a people person, so it’s very easy to become fond of her. It is here, between the Levi jeans and Guess shirts, that I got to know her better. And that she was homeless. One would never say. She is bubbly and has this infectious giggle. I want our readers to share the life and triumphs of this remarkable woman. “I am very proud today,” she beams. “But two years ago, proud is the last word I would have used. I was an addict for 22 years - 22 years of sheer hell, loss and uncertainty. But something good came from it. I met my now husband.” I can see the glow on her face as she speaks with fondness about him. “I spend many years on the road. I started out in Grassy Park, of all places. I know jail inside out. It is not that I did not try to stop using. I went to many rehab facilities but never had the power to stay clean.” “Under a bridge in Salt River I met my hubby, who introduced me to UTurn Ministries, and my journey to sobriety started. “It was hard work. I had to let go of all the friends and people I used with, to avoid a relapse. The fact that I have my two daughters back in my life made it all worthwhile. And I found a good man.” As I am about to leave the store, she shouts: “Danny! Never take anything for granted.” Contact UTurn: info@homeless.org.za or call 021 674 6119. * Danny Oosthuizen is the #TheDignityProject ambassador.

This is why the Cape Argus, together with Pick n Pay, wants to acknowledge those heroes who affect positive change in their communities through the Make a Difference Campaign. And this week Miriam Davids from Lotus River was nominated as a hero for her efforts to assist children in her community with a plate of food and spiritual guidance.

She started serving 20 children a day four years ago and now serves up to a 100 children a meal, on occasion through donations she receives. “I give bread every day and food occasionally. There are one or two people who support me, but they also don’t have the means to help. Once or twice a month I give 100 people food. “I never take it as a feeding scheme, people label it that, but for me it was just normal. Whatever I get, I would dish out. It’s not like I’m doing something special.” Davids said she was humbled by being selected as a community hero and felt blessed at being acknowledged. Another community member who was nominated for making a difference was Fazlin Khatieb, who unfortunately was unavailable to chat to the Argus about her efforts to assist her community. According to Rayehanah Cassiem, who nominated Khatieb, Khatieb had been treating the elderly in her community to a meal and took them on outings to bring a smile to their faces. Both heroes will received a voucher from Pick n Pay for their selfless work. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

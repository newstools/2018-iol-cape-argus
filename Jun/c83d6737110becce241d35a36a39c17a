Botha testified in sentencing proceedings of the accused: Jathiem Hamid, Dorian Diedericks and Cedric Andrew. In court on Tuesday, Hamid and Andrew, who had both pleaded not guilty, but were convicted of the murder, apologised and admitted to the crime. Andrew on the other hand, was convicted for possession of a firearm. He was the one who hid the weapon at his home, under his bed. Piet Botha was killed on the Netreg stations platform on July 16, 2016. He was on a refresher course where he trained new train drivers. Just an hour before his death he sent his wife a WhatsApp message saying “Danger”, only for her to be told a few hours later that he had been killed. An emotional Botha pleaded with Judge Mark Sher to give the harshest punishment possible. “I realise that the accused were still young when the murder was committed, but they were fully aware of what they were doing. There is no way that I can get my husband back or that my children can get their father back,” she said. Botha told the court a life imprisonment sentence would ensure that the accused do not commit the same crime and hurt another family again. “Financially and emotionally my family is ruined. I ask that the court give them life because I will have to live without my husband my whole life,” she sobbed. The widower said during the trial she did not see any remorse from any of the accused. It was at that point that Hamid’s lawyer, advocate Nicky Oosthuizen, asked the court for a short adjournment to consult with his client. Upon return he passed a message on to Botha. “My client says he is sorry. He says he is the one that pulled the trigger. He is very sorry for what he did” In reply Botha said: “My child I wish you could understand that you did feel the pain that we feel. I feel sorry for your parents.” During judgment, Judge Sher said murder was cold-blooded. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

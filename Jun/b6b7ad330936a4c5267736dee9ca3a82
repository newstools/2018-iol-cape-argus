An hour before he was killed he sent his wife a WhatsApp message saying “Danger”. Hours later she was informed that he had been killed. During his ruling, Judge Sher said Botha’s murder was cold-blooded. Botha’s widow, Tanya Botha, had shared her grief with the court and asked for the harshest punishment. On Wednesday, she said she was satisfied with the sentence. “They got what they deserved. “The trial was part one and now part two is for me to continue with my life,” she said. The United National Transport Union welcomed the sentence. General secretary Steve Harris said with the sentence the court had sent out a clear message to all criminals that senseless crimes on defenceless Passenger Rail Agency of SA staff would not be tolerated. “This union is grateful that the court heard our appeals. Too many lives have been lost, beaten, raped and assaulted on our railway lines that have become a war zone for those who have to work on it and to those who have no other alternative but to use trains,” added Harris. Metrorail Western Cape regional manager Richard Walker welcomed the sentence. “Throwing the book at these criminals and locking them behind bars and throwing away the key will not bring back our beloved and missed colleague, but will at least ensure that Piet’s death was not in vain,” he said. Transport and Public Works MEC Donald Grant said the sentence was appropriate and fitting for the heinous crime. “We hope it will serve as a deterrent to other would-be offenders seeking to target the rail network and threaten the safety of both commuters and Metrorail employees. “It is my sincere hope that the Botha family can now begin to find closure and acceptance,” said Grant. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

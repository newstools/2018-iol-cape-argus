The ship, which was captained by Daniel Postman, left Port Elizabeth on May 31, as part of the SA Environmental Observation Network, to retrieve data from a number of scientific buoys deployed in coastal waters to monitor the Agulhas current and its role in climate change. The expedition allowed the trainees and on-board cadets, who have not had any formal training, to be exposed to the maritime sector. It also allowed them to gain practical sea-time experience towards their international seafaring qualifications. The trainees who docked in Cape Town on Wednesday described their mission as an eye-opener to the possibilities that lie within the maritime sector for employment and experience. Lihle Hlongwane said: “My experience on board was amazing. “We were taught about ship maintenance, how to tie the ship for gangway access, and were given tasks such as taking shifts to control access on the decks and prevent outsiders from disturbing proceedings inside.” Thabile Mkhize, who took maritime studies in high school, said: “This was the best experience for me. “The training didn’t feel like we were at work, it was too much fun. This made the whole expedition priceless and life-changing.” The SA Maritime Safety Authority’s chief operating officer, Sobantu Tilayi, said: “Their actions on board over the past two weeks showed us there is a clear resolve to beat the odds, roll up their sleeves and work for a living. We are proud of these young people.” @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

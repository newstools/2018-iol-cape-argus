Dempers said that, due to the state of decomposition of the body, it was not possible to determine when the injuries were inflicted. Courtney went missing on May 4, 2017. Her body was found, nine days later, buried in a shallow grave in Epping Industria. An autopsy examination conducted by Dr Aloysia Ogle, under Dempers's supervision, found that the child's vagina had sustained tear wounds and that the vaginal opening had been stretched significantly. “There were multiple lacerations caused by an object. It was stretched too far, over-extended. Penetration by an adult's penis could have been the cause,” he said. Mortimer Saunders, the man accused of Courtney’s rape and murder, has admitted to giving her ant poison and strangling her to death. He has, however, denied raping her. Dempers said it was difficult to determine the cause of death in the case. He said, however, there were three possibilities. “It was poisoning, manual strangulation (asphyxia), and/or smothering. It was a challenging case because of the body's state of decomposition." Dempers told the court that decomposition began at the onset of death. In this case, he said, “when the body was found there was blue discolouration on the face, the upper eyelid, under the hairline, and the upper lip”. The body also showed two lesions, which were suspicious in terms of bruising: one on the forehead and a distinct one on the eyelid. Dempers said that, during examination, it was noted that the brain had partially liquefied due to decomposition. He said it was soft and had very little structure. The defence asked for a recess before cross-examining Dempers. The case continues on August 6. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

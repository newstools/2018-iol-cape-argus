The centre is hoped to lead studies in the neuroscience field and treat brain and nervous system disorders that burden the population. The centre will be home to the newly-established UCT Neuroscience Institute together with the GSH Clinical Neuroscience Centre. Researchers and clinicians from both centres will be able to work together to study and treat central nervous system infections and mental and health challenges faced in South Africa.

The Neuroscience Institute is one of these (which will) advance medical care while helping to understand the human brain. “Doing so in an African context gives us a unique opportunity to solve local problems, contribute to knowledge and build capacity in a fast-moving area of scholarship,” said Price. UCT spokesperson, Nombuso Shabalala said a fund-raising campaign lead by UCT director of the Neuroscience Institute and head of surgery and neurosurgery Professor Graham Fieggen secured the R125million needed for the centre. The centre is being built in the J-block building at Groote Schuur Hospital which will be expanded and refurbished. It will include a neuroscience academic department, a neurosurgical skills laboratory, a human tissues repository and a state-of-the-art lecture theatre. The institute is expected to be completed in September. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

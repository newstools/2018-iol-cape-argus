Cape Town - Scores of Gugulethu residents benefitted from a visit from Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille on Thursday, when they received wheelchairs, walkers and commodes from the under-fire politician. At least 10 wheelchairs, 20 walkers and 10 commodes were handed over to senior citizens and residents with disabilities, many of whom are bedridden because they lack mobility aids. "One of the beneficiaries, Dideka Mangena, was diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease and has been bedridden for months without access to this medical equipment," said De Lille. "Another beneficiary had her leg amputated and had great difficulty using her old wheelchair and struggles to use ablution facilities. "Donating this equipment today is in line with our IDP objectives of creating a caring and inclusive city by ensuring that residents with disabilities can still have mobility to go about their daily lives," she said. De Lille praised Gugulethu ward councillor Luvuyo Zondani for his work in the community and for identifying the need. "The councillor has partnered with the SACLA Health Project, which provides care for sickly people and the elderly who are not able to wash themselves. They also visit patients at their homes and ensure that they take their medication on a daily basis," she said. "I also urged qualifying Gugulethu residents to take up the opportunity provided by the Cityâ€™s indigent social package. "We have made available nearly R3 billion in the upcoming financial year to provide rates rebates and indigent relief to qualifying residents," she said. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

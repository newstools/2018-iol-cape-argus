CAPE TOWN – President Cyril Ramaphosa will attend the second Springbok Test match against England in Bloemfontein on Saturday, which will also be Youth Day. Sport and Recreation Minister Tokozile Xasa said that Ramaphosa “will commemorate the class of 1976 who ignited the spirit of resistance at Orlando, Soweto. The Springboks victory will be a befitting tribute to our heroes”. June 16 will also see new Bok captain Siya Kolisi celebrate his 27th birthday. The Boks produced a stirring comeback at Ellis Park on Saturday night to beat the English 42-39 after trailing 24-3 in the first half, with debutant wings Sbu Nkosi (2) and Aphiwe Dyantyi scoring tries. The match was also a historic occasion as Kolisi became the first black African Springbok captain. “Our boys represented us with pride, you could see their determination and spirit of unity. I had no doubt in my mind that they will win the game despite their initial 3-24 setback. If we can all emulate the Springbok spirit of never-say-die attitude, we can achieve a lot as people,” Xasa said. “Once more, I would like to congratulate our boys for a job well done, in particular our captain Siya Kolisi and the bravery of our coach Rassie Erasmus for showing confidence in youth.” The second Test at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein next Saturday will start at 5.05pm. The final match in the series will take place at Newlands in Cape Town on June 23. @ashfakmohamed  IOL Sport  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter

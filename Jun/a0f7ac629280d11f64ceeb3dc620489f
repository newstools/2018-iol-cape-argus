The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds’ (Sanccob’s) executive director, Dr Stephen van der Spuy, said it would cost R15million to build. Most of the funds have been raised and the rest of the money required will be raised through a 10-month “donate-a-brick” campaign, where the public will be asked to make donations. “We have a shortfall of funds to complete this much-needed building project,” Van der Spuy said.

As part of its work, Sanccob rehabilitates African penguins,an endangered species. The new hospital will consist of two intensive-care units for birds, a three-part wash bay area for oiled birds, an expanded surgery, a laboratory, a medication room, a new X-ray room and a walk-in freezer to store an increased amount of fish. The pen and pool area at Sanccob’s premises in Table View are being revamped to include three new pools, four new pens and an enlarged aviary. For visitors, a new viewing platform at the centre of the facility will offer a unique vantage point to view the pen areas. The development will allow Sanccob to rehabilitate greater numbers of sea birds, and to educate more people about the plight of endangered sea bird species. Sanccob takes in about 2500 ill, injured, oiled and abandoned sea birds every year, of which half are endangered African penguins, the only penguin species endemic to the African continent. @RusanaPhilander Cape Argus

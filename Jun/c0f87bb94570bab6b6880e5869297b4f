In our communities, the young and old sit and smoke, and drink together. Mothers and fathers share their liquor and smoke with their children. Young girls are raising their young. With all this in mind, where are we going? Being an educator and witnessing these ills are scary. My words fail me in describing these atrocities. RELATED - #16DaysForYouth: Rising against hunger and poverty What are we doing in the townships, educating children for the cheap labour market? “No we are not.” The children must become successful when done with school and go on to be someone who is respected in life. With the 16 Days for Youth initiative by Heart FM radio station I feel compelled to write this piece. Let’s stop blaming the past and focus on the future. Let our struggles in our communities such as Hanover Park encourage us to become better and disciplined youth. Parents, young and old must be taken by the hand and be taught how to be a “good” parent. The belief is that with good parents we can turn things around for our youth. I believe we can eradicate gangsterism, poverty, schools drop-outs and many more ills. It is about time that those in high places listen to the people on the ground. * P Hendricks, Hanover Park. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers. Cape Argus

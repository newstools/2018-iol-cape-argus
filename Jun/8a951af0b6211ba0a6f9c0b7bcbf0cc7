Fourteen-year-old Siyahluma Tyhalani, 13-year-old Vukile Tyhalani, 12-year-old Lunathi Filtane, their cousin, and two-year-old twins Lithemba and Lunje Tyhalani died in a fire in the Mesiya informal settlement in Philippi on Saturday. Their sister, Nangamso Tyhalani, 19, was heartbroken.

These were my boys; I regarded all of them as my children,” said Lunathi’s father, Mahlubandile Ningi. “All I want to say to them is rest in peace. I will always love them.” Ward councillor Siphiwo Nqamduku said: “What destroys me the most is to see our young ones die. These were going to be our future presidents, but Satan decided to take them during Youth Month. We must keep supporting the Tyhalani family.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

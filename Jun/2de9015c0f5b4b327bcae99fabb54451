Dancers draped in silky silver robes and glittery pink tutus wowed audiences when they performed renditions of ballet favourites such as The Nutcracker, The Cabaret Club and Romeo and Juliet and it didn’t cost the audience a cent to experience it. The concert, hosted for free by Artscape, formed part of the theatre’s quarterly lunch-hour concerts which add midday magic to the city and expose audiences to Artscape’s offerings. RELATED: Alan Committie's Love Factually is comedy at its best “The quarterly production is targeted at people in the City Bowl to give them something to do at lunchtime. It’s done with associate partners such as the Cape Town Opera, Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra, Unmute Dance Company and the Zip Zap Circus. “Today is the Cape Town City Ballet’s turn to showcase what they have. It allows people to see what’s on offer and also what the Artscape has to offer,” said Artscape marketing manager Simone Heradien. Dancers who performed on stage took the audience’s breath away with a short performance of The Nutcracker by Laura Rosenberg and Daniel Szybkowski who captivated the strength and beauty portrayed by ballet dancers on stage.

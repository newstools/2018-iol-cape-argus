The self-taught crew, which includes Mlondi Ndlovu, Khulekani Ndimande, Enver Moolla and Phiwah Zwane, have been sharing a stage together since 2013. Their love of dance has now landed them a spot among the world’s top performers who will take to the stage on July 26. The World of Dance competition boasts Jennifer Lopez as its executive producer and is the largest international urban dance competition focusing on street dancing. The competition is represented in over 25 countries and draws dancers from around the world. The crew is currently raising funds in order to participate in the competition and has managed to raise close to R200000 so far to get to Los Angeles. Moolla, who works as a dance teacher, said they were putting together a family day to get the remainder of the funds needed for their trip abroad. “As Survivors, we strive to share our talents and knowledge with youth and up-and-coming performers and dancers in Durban. We teach extramural dance and we also host dance workshops,” Moolla said. “Our biggest challenge now is getting sponsorships. "We really urge people to help us as we want to hold the South African flag high and represent our country. We want to show the world what South Africans are capable of,” said Moolla. He said the Survivors Dance Crew was set to perform at the Family Day event at Four15 restaurant on Mackeurtan Avenue in Durban North on July 1. Families and children can look forward to dancing, a free meal, free face-painting and a slime challenge.

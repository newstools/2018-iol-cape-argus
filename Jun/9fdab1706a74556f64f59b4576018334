“I invited officials from the City’s Environmental Health and Problem Buildings Unit to the area. The conditions at the site constitute a serious health hazard and pose a risk to those people staying at the site,” Bryant said. He said officials had committed to take up the matter with the Department Public Works (DPW) to urgently compel them to address the health and safety issues. RELATED: Tenants from Cape Town's Zonnebloem now face evictions “It is unacceptable that the DPW has allowed the building to deteriorate and to continue to show such scant regard for those people living on the property.” Bryant said the City was not involved in any eviction proceedings at the site and all matters relating to the occupancy lay with the property owner. Eighteen families are occupying the building that was leased out by the national DPW. The building has become neglected and faces a number of challenges. “We applaud the City for visiting the area so they can see how those residents live,” said the inner city organiser of Reclaim the City, Ntombi Sambu. Reclaim the City has recently shifted its focus to 104 Darling Street in Zonnebloem, a dilapidated building controlled by the national DPW. “The department has told the residents for years that it will be repaired and they are still waiting,” Sambu said. Meanwhile, the City’s Transport and Urban Development Authority said that over the next three financial years it would spend the bulk of its capital budget on the provision of housing, new roads to relieve traffic congestion, and on infrastructure for the roll-out of the MyCiTi service to Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha. “The operating budget is about R3.6 billion, and R1.77bn is budgeted for projects,” said mayco member for Transport and Urban Development Brett Herron. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

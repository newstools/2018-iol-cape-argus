A total of 25 contestants strutted their stuff on stage in three different categories, namely Miss LGBTI Cape Peninsula, Mr LGBTI Cape Peninsula and Miss Lesbian Cape Peninsula 2018. Laylah Zokufa Khan, 25, from Mitchells Plain scooped the title of Miss LGBTI when she wowed judges in her beige swimwear and then a red evening gown. RELATED: We're just two people in love, says ostracised queer couple “I want to inspire change and show Cape Town that we as LGBTI members are no different to other humans we’re just more special,” she said. Effect Riaan Phillips, 35, from Durbanville, looked cool in his checked suit as he spoke out about the negative effect that in-fighting has on the LGBTI community. He scored top marks in the swimwear section and won the Mr LGBTI Cape Peninsula title. “When my name was called out as the new ambassador for the EVH Empire, it felt like a dream had become reality,” he said. Bulelwe Ntlayi, 25, from Blue Downs won the Lesbian category. “For a first timer, this was quite special. I am grateful for the title and will wear it boldly,” she said proudly. The winners won a number of prizes including a study bursary, hair products, fashion and hair vouchers, model training vouchers and more. Organiser Enigma Von Hamburg says the pageant was a great success. “I’m pleased with the newly crowned King and Queens and have no doubt that they will utilise this platform to continue to create positive movement, not only in the LGBTI community but the Western Cape,” Von Hamburg says.  venecia.valentine@inl.co.za  Daily Voice

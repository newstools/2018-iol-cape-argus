Anele Gabuza, councillor for the Endlovini informal settlement, said since the rain had started early on Thursday residents had been worrying about their homes.

"As a procedure, when homes are flooded, the people are supposed to be relocated to the nearest community hall for safety and shelter. "Judging by the heavy rain, it is unlikely that they will be able to sleep in their homes,” he said. Gabuza said the only solution to the flooding, especially in the informal settlements, was to build residents proper houses. “People can’t continue living like this." Councillor Stembile Mfecane, of Asanda Village, said the roofs of at least 25 RDP houses had been blown off. “The situation is really bad here. The challenge is that because these are RDP houses, the City says it cannot assist. "The City says it is up to the owners to insure their homes, but with what? Many of these homeowners are unemployed. "They can hardly maintain these homes. It's a real challenge,” he said. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

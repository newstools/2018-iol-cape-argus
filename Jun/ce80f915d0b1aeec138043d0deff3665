Cape Town’s own crooner, Chad Saaiman is back with a new single. It’s called Play and is the lead that will appear on his upcoming fourth album. Although he’s singing about wanting his significant other back, the mid-tempo bop makes Play such a feel good song. Plus he ropes in Mr Cape Town himself, YoungstaCPT, for a guest verse on the song. The video features some cool animation that will be reminiscent of Bruno Mars’ That’s What I Like music video, but at the time of writing already had over 800 people have given it the thumbs up so maybe they don’t mind the similarities. There is innuendo that can be attributed to why Chad wants this girl to not move to NYC or do exactly what she wants to do and must instead stay with him so he can play? But that aside, it’s humorous to see a man sweating about being left alone when it’s usually the other way around. Chad gets advice from Craig David and Rihanna but does any of it help? Watch the video to find out.

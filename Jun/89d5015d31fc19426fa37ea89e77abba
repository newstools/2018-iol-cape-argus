“The state has already failed us if two attacks like this have already occurred, coupled with other major crimes No matter what resources the government employs, it will be difficult to deal with extreme groups because it is dependent on foreign workings,” he said. During her Budget vote speech in May, State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba said: “We will conduct a review of the relevance of the training curriculum content of our Intelligence Academy so that we can assure ourselves that our officers receive the highest standard of training to ensure competence in fulfilling national security requirements.” On terrorism, she said although there had been no major terror attack in the country, citizens should continue to be vigilant and not lower their guard. “We will also continue the partnerships that we have established with a number of communities and civil society structures and will continue to have extensive engagements with international partners in our quest to improve co-operation on these matters.” Brian Fikani, communications head at the department, downplayed these concerns, saying the mosque attacks, along with other serious crimes, were being investigated. The Muslim Judicial Council’s Mishka Darries said many rumours had been spread regarding the motive for the attacks. “We humbly request that we (along with the media) do not jump to conclusions Hawks and SAPS need to finalise their investigation I am certain they will share their findings as soon as possible.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Cape Town â€“ Convicted cable thief Fortune Nkomo on Thursday received a 15 year jail sentence. Nkomo received 10 years for cable theft of train roof cables with an estimated value of R250 000 and another 5 years for malicious damage to property. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker was elated. "The Western Cape is long overdue for a guilty verdict - the sentence is only the beginning of a concerted and collaborative programme of action to eradicate theft and vandalism of rail infrastructure. "It underscores the importance and urgency with which PRASA tackles the scourge of cable theft," Walker said. He congratulated the collaboration of Metrorail Protection Services with various SAPS units as well as private security contractors. "All our security interventions such as drone surveillance, intelligence and public tip-offs are coming together to enable the Criminal Matters Amendment Act to be applied effectively," he said. Walker said the verdict and sentence sent a clear message that the theft of state assets and infrastructure would be met with "more than just a rap over the knuckles". "Our embattled customers have suffered at the hands of Nkomo and others of his ilk for too long, the wheel of justice has finally turned in the favour of rail commuters." He said Prasa would continue to tackle thieves, vandals and illegal scrap dealers who continue to accept stolen copper. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The campaign, in its third year, has already touched the lives of thousands of people in the Western Cape - from the beneficiaries and their families, to the listeners, volunteers and readers. Many people have expressed a keen interest in getting involved and to streamline this process, Heart FM has set up a crowdfunding campaign so that people can continue to donate towards those in need, long after the initiative has run its course. RELATED - #16DaysForYouth: Heart FM wins smiles in Mount Pleasant “The ThundaFund for 16 Days was set up to fund projects in addition to what we had set out to do at the beginning of our journey,” programming manager Denver Apollus said. “The technology of the fund makes it easier to streamline the donation process and is also very transparent - members who donate are able to track their donation and specify what it should be used for in the case of a specific beneficiary. “The funds deposited into the account are used for all 16 Days For Youth projects, whether this is for buying additional pots and pans, or using it for Power Hour to buy electricity for the beneficiaries, instead of approaching a sponsor for this. “We have to thank the people of the Western Cape who have to date donated R22270 and in their way make it possible to bring change within these communities,” he said. The aim is to raise R100 000 for the campaign. If you want to contribute to the ThundaFund, you can do so at https://www.thundafund.com/project/16daysforyouth @16DaysForYouth Cape Argus

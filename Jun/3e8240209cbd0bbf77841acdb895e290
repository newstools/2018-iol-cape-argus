Although relatively unknown across South Africa, tag rugby is popular across Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Ireland. It is often used to introduce a wider range of people to rugby and to supplement traditional training methods. Since its beginnings in 1993, Oztag has grown in popularity across Australia in urban and rural areas. Twenty-eight teams participated in the first season in summer 1992 to 1993 playing in the Cronulla and St George areas of Sydney. Today, well over 160Â 000 players take part in Oztag competitions nationally. Later this year, 190 teams will travel to Coffs Harbour in Australia to compete across a variety of age groups. Tag rugby, due to its non-contact nature, provides a fantastic opportunity for male and female players to participate alongside one another, generating an inclusive and welcoming environment for a wide range of athletes. Tag rugby can be played socially and competitively, with flexible rules to cater for players of different abilities. Rules are also in place to encourage women to participate; specifically, more points are awarded to female try scorers and males can be prohibited from taking the kick-offs. The South African team are seeking sponsors to fund their World Cup bid. They also have a candystick account for donations which can be found at https://candystick.co.za/c/tag-world-cup-2018/.

The book, titled Alfie’s African Animals Colouring-in Book, encourages both creativity and literacy with each page, which includes a drawing of an animal accompanied by a short story about it. Vroom explained that the book was inspired by five-year-old Alfie, whom he met while visiting the Island of Poros in Greece. RELATED: Another groundbreaking surgery at Groote Schuur Hospital Alfie had a love for his soft toy tiger which spurred on many conversations between the two about Africa’s own great animals. It wasn’t long before Vroom bought a drawing pad and a pen, and started creating the colouring-in book. “Alfie had spent most of his first years in a children’s hospital due to medical complications. He is also a miracle child, and this prompted me to investigate whether the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital would be interested in the colouring-in book. “The journey lies in what the book can hopefully achieve, providing children with some fun and creativity and a little knowledge about the wildlife of Africa that should remain precious to all of us,” said Vroom. The hospital was intrigued by Vroom’s idea, and with the help of long-time hospital sponsor Pick n Pay to facilitate the printing of the books, Alfie’s African Animals Colouring-in Book became a reality for the children. Pick n Pay transformation director Suzanne Ackerman-Berman said the books were a welcome distraction for the children, to take their minds off their medical conditions, even if for just for a little while. In addition, 1 000 wax crayon wallets were also donated alongside the books, so that the children could bring their drawings to life. Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital chief executive, Dr Matodzi Mukosi, said the hospital was grateful and humbled by the donation, which would brighten the lives of the young patients and assist with their rehabilitation and treatment. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

This after he conducted an oversight visit to the office in the Foreshore. Hoosen spoke to asylum seekers who shared their frustrations with the process as well as the conditions at the current premises, which pose a health hazard to both asylum seekers and staff. “Clearly, the failure by Minister (Malusi) Gigaba (of Home Affairs) to obey the courts is compromising the ability of the department to ensure asylum applications are processed and finalised efficiently,” Hoosen said.

The Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town and the Somali Association of South Africa have launched a case against the Department of Home Affairs for not complying with orders of the court to open the Refugee Reception Office in Cape Town. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

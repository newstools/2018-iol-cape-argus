He was commenting after DA chief whip Mark Wiley said in a statement that he had been neglecting his duties in the legislature and had a record of absenteeism. Wiley said they were appalled by the absence of Joseph, noting a severe lack of interest and participation in parliamentary activities. “Besides being absent from a high number of house sittings the EFF member has, over the past two quarters, not attended any of the parliamentary oversight committee meetings. Furthermore, the EFF missed the parliamentary deadline to submit its subject of discussion to the Speaker’s office The EFF essentially wastes valuable time at provincial parliament which should be used to serve the very people who elect our public representatives,” Wiley said. But Joseph said he was wasting his time inside the legislature and was focusing on listening to service delivery issues in communities and building EFF structures. “I can’t sit here and waste time debating on matters while we have people suffering out there. We are building our structures in the EFF and listening to communities concerns. We are wasting time here debating issues, when our communities are suffering,” he said. Joseph said he had been raising issues in communities where protests had flared up. Wiley said he had since tabled a motion without notice, that the house express its grave concern at Joseph’s regular and continued absence from proceedings of the legislature. He said they believed that the space occupied by the EFF could be better utilised by a responsible member willing to serve the people of this province. “It is deplorable that the EFF is neglecting its responsibilities and duties at the legislature, and clearly demonstrates that the EFF do not have Western Cape residents’ interests at heart.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

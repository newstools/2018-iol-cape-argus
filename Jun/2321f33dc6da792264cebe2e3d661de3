This R61 million newly built Thembalethu Community Day Centre was officially opened by the Western Cape Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo Monday. “We are proud to be handing over this state-of-the-art facility to the community of Thembalethu. It is important to ensure that the healthcare package offered in our facilities suits the needs of our communities, and we constantly have to expand our services.

We continuously strive to offer the best services to all our clients in the best possible facilities,” Mbombo added. The new 3490m² facility in Nelson Mandela Boulevard could no longer accommodate the growing population’s health needs. The Thembalethu Community Day Centre has a staff component of 44 and renders the full package of primary healthcare services, with additional rehabilitation services. This centre is divided into units for infectious disease; chronic care; acute treatment; and a pharmacy. The facility also makes provision for oral health, women and child health, and rehabilitation and therapy services. @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

On Wednesday, Christopher Brown appeared in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court accused of raping and murdering Stacey. Community members heard that he had a pending murder and assault case against him. Brown is the former boyfriend of Stacey’s mother. State prosecutor Juwaya Kleinsmith told the court the State intended to oppose bail. She said Brown had pending murder and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm cases. Court records showed Brown had two additional pending assault cases, a crimen injuria matter and an illegal possession of firearm case. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the pending cases were withdrawn pending finalisation of the police investigation into them. Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum spokesperson Faizel Brown said the community only found out about the other cases after Stacey’s murder. “The community is angry that a repeat offender was released back into our community. People should have been made aware of this information. We should have been told that he was charged with murder,” he said. Community member Sherhardien Salie said the justice system favoured criminals. “We fear for our own children. We are living in fear, not knowing whose child will be next. “There are more (repeat offenders) out there who are planning to do the same thing this man did to defenceless children. “The law favours criminals and has failed us.” Manenberg Safety Forum chairperson Roegshanda Pascoe said the judicial system and Correctional Services should be held accountable for their failure to monitor repeat offenders. Community Safety MEC Dan Plato said people close to Brown were aware of the pending cases. Plato said he would be discussing the matter of repeat offenders and procedures followed at a safety meeting to be held in Elsies River. Magistrate Cathy Steyn postponed the case to July 24, when a bail application will be heard. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Papageorgiou, who climbs Lion’s Head as part of his Lion 500 initiative to mount Lion’s Head 500 times this year for charity, said he’s seen an increase in graffiti. “What started with one or two little graffiti marks has grown. It’s gone from names to political beliefs. “People go out into nature to escape politics and enjoy nature. It’s a very shallow thing to do. “It’s criminal but because cops can’t keep graffiti off walls, people think it’s okay. You’re in the jurisdiction of Mother Nature,” said Papageorgiou. Together with Blake Dyason, who created Love our Trails, which hosts regular clean-ups on the trail routes, Papageorgiou is planning to host a mountain clean-up on Lion’s Head next month to get people to take ownership of the mountain. The Love Our Trails movement has hosted many mountain clean-ups in an effort to protect trails by changing the behaviour of people towards the natural environment. Dyason said “trails give us so much and it’s our duty to give something back so that future generations can experience the magic of nature”. The mountain clean-up is planned for July 15.

But more assistance is now needed for Franciska Klein, who was run over by a car near her home in Durbanville early last year, said Ria Wagner, a facilitator at Paarl School for the neurologically disabled. “Her father is a general worker on the Altydgedacht wine farm and her mother was a seasonal worker, but now has to take care of Franciska full time. The dad can only provide for the family’s basic needs, but with Franciska’s injury comes new financial challenges,” Wagner said.

We have come a long way since the accident, but the last few months have been challenging. “Franciska’s dad brought her to school every morning because no other scholar transport wanted to, because she is such a high risk - she can’t breathe on her own. "But her dad’s car broke down early last month and she now has no safe way of getting to and from school,’ she said. “We want to get the word out about this girl, and the help we desperately need.” A fund account is run by a primary school.

The report said Cape Town retained the biggest share of planned hotel development in South Africa despite showing a decrease in total planned rooms. Compared with last year, development was slowing in Cape Town and Pretoria, with the number of planned rooms down 22% and 28%, respectively. RELATED: Cape Town still has it all for business and leisure travellers In contrast, Durban, Johannesburg and uMhlanga were seeing growth of 40%, 23% and 113%, respectively. Cape Town has 25% of the South African development pipeline, with 1063 rooms in six hotels, and Durban 16% with 697 rooms in five hotels, an increase of 40% on last year, Pretoria has 11% of the pipeline with 463 rooms in three hotels, while Joburg has 10% with 432 rooms in four hotels and uMhlanga 7% with 298 rooms in two hotels. Trevor Ward, W Hospitality’s managing director, said: “Year-on-year performance for Africa as a whole in 2018 shows growth, but more muted than in recent years: 25% growth in the number of pipeline rooms in 2015; 19% in 2016, and 13% in 2017, much the same as the 14% growth in 2018.” Ward said while Cape Town continued to offer great opportunities for hotel investment, it was exciting to see new hotel construction projects all over South Africa, in places such as Addo, Ballito, Boschendal, Hermanus, Kruger, Malelane, Mossel Bay, Nelspruit, Paarl, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Rosebank, St Francis, Stellenbosch and Tsitsikama. This year’s report, now in its 10th edition, had 41 contributors reporting 418 deals over 100 brands across Africa.

Nkololo faced two charges of rape as well as charges of kidnapping and murder. It is the State’s case that on April 30 last year he kidnapped Iyapha, raped her and strangled her to death. Iyapha went missing while playing outside her aunt’s home. Her body was found stuffed in a plastic bag the following day. Nkololo was linked to the crimes by DNA evidence. Just a month before, it is alleged he raped a close friend’s 7-year-old daughter on March 24, 2017. Both incidents occurred in Town Two, Khayelitsha. Nkololo pleaded not guilty to all the charges. He said he was forced to give a confession. The trial dealt with both rapes and a trial-within-a trial was heard for the confession. State prosecutor, advocate Thabo Ntela submitted in his heads of arguments that the State had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Nkololo was guilty of the charges he faced. As part of the investigation into Iyapha’s murder the police investigation team with the guidance of the prosecution team embarked on a novel project. “The project entailed swabbing all males in the Town Two area for DNA. It started with boys aged between 10 and 14 years old, it then included all males in the area for voluntary swabbing. Information was received that the accused was one of the males evading having his DNA taken and that is how he was arrested.” said Ntela. Ntela added: “It is respectfully submitted that the independent and objective evidence of the DNA is irrefutable proof that the accused was present during the commission of the offences...” @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

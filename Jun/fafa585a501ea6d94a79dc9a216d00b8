Dr Siona O’Connell, who is an academic at the University of Pretoria, said the film would be released in July. It is called Uitgesmyt. She said it differs from her previous film An Impossible Return. “That film centred on urban apartheid-era forced evictions yet Uitgesmyt looked at rural race-based evictions. “This one focuses on the rural towns and settlements in the Cedarberg region, particularly, Citrusdal and Elandskloof, which was the first successful restitution case in post-apartheid South Africa,” she said. O’Connell said her new film looked at the residents returning to the area 22 years ago and draws attention to lessons that still need to be learnt about how community is understood “as well as looking at the cycle of poverty and the persistent psycho-social effects of being evicted”. “In some ways, the film speaks about the discarded and the inter-generational effects of being kicked out of one’s home, due to the Group Areas Act,” she said. She said the 26-minute film came after research she did into land and restitution. “It was a collaboration between the Department of Historical and Heritage Studies, at the University of Pretoria, and the Centre for Curating the Archive at UCT. “The film addresses the failures and opportunities of restitution, with regard to forced removals during apartheid. It is relevant not only because the question of land is at the forefront of social and political debate, but it highlights poverty as well as the day-to-day realities of groups of people in this area, who seem to be forgotten,” she said. @RusanaPhilander  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

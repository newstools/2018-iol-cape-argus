There have been several protests in Hermanus, Botrivier near Caledon and Riebeek Kasteel near Malmesbury where infrastructure has been totally wrecked and small towns brought to a standstill. RELATED: Hangberg land invaders violate peace accord In the latests protest, residents of Riebeek Kasteel went on the rampage destroying a wine cellar, shops and private homes. The municipality said several people were arrested. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said South Africans have for the past four years been hearing about corruption and maladministration daily. “The people are genuinely fed up. You cannot say that there are any third forces involved because if there was little inequality and access to services for everyone, there would be few protests. But wherever we have seen these violent protests, people don’t have access to services,” he said. Mathekga also said government in all spheres have failed to deliver services to its most vulnerable. “The gap between rich and poor has been growing. There are huge differences between communities and people are literally fed up. When is the best time to negotiate with politicians... it's election time. It’s the only time people’s concerns will be taken seriously. We are going to see people protesting even more as the elections come closer." Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela was locked in a meeting with mayors from across the province on Tuesday. He is to brief the media today, 13 June on the several land grabs and violence protests in the province. Last month, Botrivier residents took to the streets in protests for housing and better services. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

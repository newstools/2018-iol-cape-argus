Cape Town - Six more important road links are being built by the City of Cape Town, with 16 more in the pipeline, to alleviate congestion in the Mother City. "In December 2015 the City committed to spend an additional R750 million over a period of five financial years on road infrastructure projects to alleviate the worst congestion pressure points in Cape Town," the City said. A congestion study prioritised Blaauwberg, Kuils River, and Kommetjie as the worst affected areas. Officials from the Transport and Urban Development Authority identified missing road network links, or roads that should be turned into dual carriageways to relieve congestion at these hotspots. Other proposed interventions included capacity improvements at busy intersections and interchanges. "Five road construction projects – one in the Blaauwberg area, three in Kuils River, and one in Bellville – were completed by May this year," mayoral committee member for transport and development Brett Herron said. "Residents from these areas would have experienced the difference by now, and are benefitting from our investment by spending less time on the road." An amount of R481 million is budgeted for congestion relief projects over the next three financial years, starting on 1 July 2018. "The money has been allocated to six road projects that are currently under construction: two in Kuils River; two in Kommetjie; one in Somerset West; and one in the Milnerton area; as well as to another 16 projects that are currently in the planning and design phase," Herron said. In April 2017 it was estimated that there was a R5 billion backlog in roads infrastructure projects across the city. Six projects focused on alleviating congestion are currently under way, the City said. 
* Widening of Van Riebeeck Road/Strand Street between the R300 and Peter Barlow Road, as well as the widening of the Van Riebeeck Road/R300 north-bound off-ramp in conjunction with SANRAL
* Dualling of Langverwacht Road between Amandel Road and the Zevenwacht Link Road
* Dualling of Kommetjie Road between Capri Drive and Ou Kaapse Weg
* Dualling of Ou Kaapse Weg between Kommetjie Road and Noordhoek Main Road
* Dualling of Broadway Boulevard from Beach to Main Roads in Somerset West
* Dualling of Bosmansdam Road between Montague Drive and Koeberg Road, in conjunction with private developers "We also need our residents to change their commuting patterns by making use of public transport as far as possible, and to try and travel outside of the peak hour periods. In this sense business can contribute by implementing flexible working hours or by allowing employees to work from home, where feasible," Herron said. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

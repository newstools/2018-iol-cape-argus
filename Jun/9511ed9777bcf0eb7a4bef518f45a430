The protest led to the Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Road at the Hout Bay Main Road traffic circle being blockaded by taxis from Wynberg to Hout Bay. They are apparently dissatisfied over taxi routes. The Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) claims the City of Cape Town has been allowing the Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) to operate on its routes illegally. Samkelo Krweqe, community leader and a member of Hout Bay Taxi Association, says it was unruly behaviour from the other drivers. However, he said, his wish was that this protest must end. “I blame this on the City for they confused our people over these routes.” Brett Herron, Mayco member for transport and urban development, said they paid the taxi associations to exit so that the MyCiTi buses could operate. “We have paid these taxi operators to exit the route from Hout Bay to Cape Town. They have been illegally using the route,” said Herron. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlmla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

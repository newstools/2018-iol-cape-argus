The biggest lion cake in the world will be on display today at the V&A Waterfront by the cake maestro for the official launch the FOUR PAWS #RiseUpAndRoar campaign. “What we are trying to do is raise awareness for lion breeding and basically the cake features five lions in a natural setting,” Klerck said. The cake is completely edible and took Klerck five weeks to make and all together 400hours to assemble. PICTURES: Life-sized elephant cake for #GFWS2017 She used 300 eggs, 80kg of moulding chocolate, 100kg of chocolate and 130kg of fondant. “The grass is sugar. The rocks are all fondant, the mane is corn silk from mielies. We had a very generous farmer who gave us loads for a few months.” Last year Klerck made a massive 1.2-ton elephant sculpted cake. It was displayed at the Good Food and Wine show. Klerck wanted to raise funds for the International Fund for Animal Welfare and Elephant Project SA at the show. The cake won her a prize at the International 2017 Cake Master Awards in Birmingham in the UK. She said the new cake allowed her to try something different. “I’ve done so many big cakes, so I wanted to try something different with this cake and provide more detail with this display.” Klerck is an expert at designing and creating unique cakes at her business Eat, Cake, Party, which creates cool 3D cake designs. She is passionate about wildlife, assembled the cake to both educate and raise awareness. The lion cake display will be unveiled today, 1 June 2018, at the V&A Waterfront where author of Cuddle me, Kill me, Richard Peirce, will reveal horrifying facts about the canned lion industry. In his book he explains the true story of two male lions rescued from breeding farms, the exploitation and misery of these apex predators when they are bred in captivity and how young cubs are removed from their mothers mere hours after birth. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

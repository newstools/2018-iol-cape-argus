The initiative started in 2016, when the station undertook youth-focused projects across the province, taking its microphone to the heart of communities, giving them a voice and making a difference. This year, a greater focus will be placed on feeding as many people as possible, in light of the soaring cost of living and food scarcity in many towns, and other projects will include supplying clothing and fixing and painting buildings. RELATED - #16DaysForYouth: HeartFM shows love for communities From today, Heart FM’s entire line-up will transmit from their outside broadcast vehicle. The initiative kicks off in Kraaifontein and will see teams travel to Lavender Hill, Bridgetown, Paternoster, Langebaan, Moorreesburg, Darling, Montana, Maitland, Kleinmond, Hermanus, Greyton, Genadendal and Bishop Lavis. The station will also revisit projects to check on progress and expansion. In 2016, the team met “Tannie” Magda Meyer, a community worker in Paarl who clothed and fed about 2000 residents on a monthly basis, using her own limited resources. With the help of the 16 Days For Youth team and sponsors, she now feeds more than 26 000 residents per month, and has branched out to other communities. Listeners can pledge their support for the campaign. Visit www.16daysforyouth.com to follow the journey.

The vessel, which departs the Waterfront on Sunday, will start a routine patrol around the French territories in the Southern Ocean, specifically to monitor the illegal fishing trade. With a length of 72m and a beam of 16m, the ship has the capacity to carry 1200 tons of freight, while also accommodating 60 people. The L’Astrolabe was built in 2017, replacing a previous icebreaker of the same name and the patrol vessel Albatross. The present version of the ship now has two main objectives: one being logistics travel to Antarctica to restock French and Australian scientific bases in Terre-Adelie Territory, and the other to conduct sovereignty missions in the Southern Ocean. Commanding Officer Francois Trystram, appointed to L’Astrolabe last June, was pleased to dock in Cape Town after a personal 20-year absence.   Under his command are at least 31 crew, though this number varies depending on the mission undertaken. L’Astrolabe employs two separate crews. Each spends half of the 300 mission days on board, while the other crew stays at L’Astrolabe’s Reunion Island base. There is no South African mission controlling the illegal fishing trade.   @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus

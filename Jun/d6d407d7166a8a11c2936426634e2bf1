Souper Troopers, started by Kerry Hoffman, has been providing the homeless with food as well as holding a monthly social event for them since 2014. It has allowed the homeless and “homefull” of society to interact and bond. RELATED: Help the homeless and win with Souper Troopers’ big raffle The event, which includes music, food and free haircuts, is run mainly by the homeless, who help in the NGO’s kitchen and make sure everything runs smoothly. However, to do more than equip the homeless with hosting skills, the NGO aims to establish a “human hub”, a place where homeless people can have food, take a shower, and be linked with companies and partners who can provide them with further skills. To generate funds, Souper Troopers are running a raffle, featuring prizes that include getaways, food vouchers and tickets for the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa. “We want to reach out to corporates to help establish the human hub,” said Souper Trooper board member, Caryn Gootkin. “There is nowhere for people on the streets to be during the day.... we want to help the homeless troopers be skilled and earn money for their work.”  The raffle draw will take place tomorrow, Souper Trooper’s official fourth birthday. The NGO is set to hold a birthday bash on Sunday.

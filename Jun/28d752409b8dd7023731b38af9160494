Cape Town - A fire has gutted an informal structure in Kensington in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The City’s Fire and Rescue spokesperson Theo Layne said: “Fire and rescue services responded at around 00:59 to a structural fire in Lugmag Ave in Kensington.” Two wood and iron structures were destroyed, 1 adult male sustained fatal burns, while 1 resident was left displaced. Layne said the probable cause of the fire could be due to an unattended candle.

The little boy and girl died when the blaze gutted the wooden structure where they were sleeping. Earlier this month, five children died in a shack fire in Philippi, and a police investigation was launched after President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed sadness. With winter peaking in, it usually brings a spike in shack fires as many informal settlements residents rely on paraffine and heaters to keep them warm. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

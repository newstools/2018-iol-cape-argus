ALSO READ: Cape Town Airport name a tongue-twister "The SACP strongly condemns the criminal behaviour and intimidation displayed at the public hearing held on Monday, 4 June 2018 at the Cape Town International Airport. This conduct has contaminated the process and must be addressed. The SACP further condemns attempts, linked with the anarchy, at suppressing Hani's name. This suppression has  unfortunately been given practical expression in media coverage," the party said. "For the record, the SACP has made its submission at the hearings. The SACP’s proposal must not be prejudiced. The Party respects the rule of law and human rights, and would NOT stoop so low in order to attract attention to its submission." @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

We miss Leigh a lot as a family,” said the mother. “The train driver told me that Leigh was panicking and was screaming hence she is struggling to breathe.” The City of Cape Town’s fire and services spokesperson Theo Layne said one body was found in a gutted coach and its gender could not be identified due to the serious burns on the body. “One person was seriously injured in the face and neck, and the other sustained minor injuries. We arrived at the scene and the power was switched off. For now the Cape Flats line is temporarily closed for the police to conduct their investigations. “However we managed to fight the fire to prevent it spreading,” said Layne. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the company was offering a reward for information on the fire. “Train crew uncoupled the burning carriages from the rest of the train to contain the damage. Commuters on board were evacuated at Ottery station, and two carriages were damaged,” said Scott. Metrorail urges anyone with information or footage of the event to provide it to the police for investigation and it would be treated in confidence. It offers a reward of R25000. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Cape Town - Western Cape #TotalShutdown Movement has distanced itself from Wednesday’s planned march to Parliament, organised by Western Cape United Safety Front, another crime-fighting organisation launched on Tuesday.A statement issued by the movement said: “We note that there is confusion in communities and we wish to clarify that our movement is not part of this initiative. We have resolved from the onset that we are tired of marching to Parliament and government institutions to hand over memoranda that amount to nothing. “We acknowledge and uphold the rights of all to organise, protest and freedom of association and see their action as something positive for our cause and appreciate the solidarity these organisations show.” According to the movement, there has been a circulation of fake messages and calls doing the rounds on social media about a shutdown that was due to take place on Tuesday. “As a movement, we are clear that our cause shall not be used for political fights and point-scoring for their race to the election polls. We are clear that our movement is for the people, by the people. We are clear that our movement is non-partisan and non-sectarian and that our cause is about building safe and healthy communities which have equal opportunities and access to resources that would increase the quality of life for our working class.” The movement’s spokesperson, Henriette Abrahams, also clarified that there was no partnership with the SA Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) “Saftu came out to support us from the beginning and (we) welcomed their support as that of other organisations; however, we have not formed any alliance and we are yet to strategise on the form that our movement will take,” she said. Leadership of the #TotalShutdown movement will be meeting Police Minister Bheki Cele today following protest action in Kensington, Factreton, Bonteheuwel and Bishop Lavis. Cape Argus

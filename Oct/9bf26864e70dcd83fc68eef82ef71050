The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) on Friday signed the settlement agreement that emerged after the meeting that took place on Wednesday, with Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu and the management of Sassa. Nehawu spokesperson Khaya Xaba said the agreement included the suspension of biometric enrolment of beneficiaries, workers will revert to the SOCPEN system that they were using and were familiar with. “An amendment of the KPA’s of grant administrators will be undertaken and Sassa will also look into the issue of remuneration for any extra added tasks to be performed by workers,” said Xaba. Zola Saphetha, Nehawu general secretary, applauded members for their high levels of resilience and discipline during the strike. He said Nehawu would continue to fight for better working conditions, decent wages and worker dignity. The union has visited all workplaces across the country, to report to members on the draft settlement agreement and used that to get a mandate for signing and demobilising. Saphetha said workers were happy with the agreement and had mandated the union to sign it. “Demobilisation has begun and workers are expected back at work on Monday.” He said the strike was suspended pending the full implementation of the settlement agreement. Before the strike, the union was adamant it would only halt the strike after demands were met. Workers were demanding the suspension of biometric enrolment of beneficiaries, consultation on biometric enrolment of beneficiaries to be prioritised, job evaluation in the grants administration to be undertaken, and the option of inclusion of the biometric enrolment in the KPA’s of specific employees to perform the function. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

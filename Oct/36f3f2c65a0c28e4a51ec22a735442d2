Leah Eckles, spokesperson for one of the vehicle-operating companies for MyCiTi, said the company has all the evidence regarding the drivers who "violently" participated in the so-called "wildcat" strike. “We are on a recruitment process as we speak and we have interviewed 60 drivers.” She said that as long as the strike is on, some routes will be off service. Eckles denied that the company had anything to do with the arrest of its five workers. “We are not going to intervene,” she said. On Tuesday, Treasure Memali, Patrick Mabindisa, Baxolele Mthengi, Luzuko Memani and Simthembile Stephen were arrested at the Civic Centre station, Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said the suspects were arrested on charges of public violence, contravening a court interdict, intimidation and malicious damage to property.

Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association chairperson Osman Shaboodien said some although young people were employed by the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP), it was not enough and they were not being paid a "decent wage". There are various programmes that are assisting residents in the area to help find employment such as the EPWP and the Waste Water, City of Cape Town. Individuals from the area are also starting their own endeavours by having their own market stalls to sell their products, cleaning the streets and being car guards in the area. However, there still remains a lack of employment in the area, especially among the youth. “There are ongoing plans and people are being pointed in the direction where they can acquire skills, such as being trained as tour guides and their are projects being undertaken to help people feel empowered. How many people take up the opportunity could be the debate. “Unemployment also remains an ongoing issue and the challenge is that it is a city problem and a national problem,” said Shaboodien. “Vagrants who are chased out of areas such as Tamboerskloof and Gardens always find their way to Bo-Kaap in the end. If there is an opportunity for people to beg then they will do it and Bo-Kaap is considered as a soft target to this type of homeless and unemployment issues. It is perceived as the culture of Bo-Kaap to always provide help to those who are in need.” There were also various programmes at the mosques and for providing help to individuals, explains Shaboodien. Adnaan Osman, chairperson of the Bo-Kaap Youth Movement said it was extremely difficult for young people to find jobs in the area. “This leads to them roaming the streets for work opportunities which doesn’t come by very often. The Bo-Kaap Youth movement is currently looking to up-skill our community through various learnership programmes and courses.” @Sukainaish  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

UCT hosted a discussion in celebration of International Open Access Week to see how open access journals could help transform academic institutions. According to lead researcher at UCT’s Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching Dr Glenda Cox, the idea of open access was about opening up research to everyone under an open copyright license. “Students are looking at fees falling, but (the) cost of textbooks is still limiting, this is where open materials come in.” Cox’s research is currently focusing on open-access models to find out who is sharing open works and to investigate the best open sharing platforms. Cox explained that the ideal situation would be for students to get their curriculum reading list and find lots of the required materials freely available. “People are afraid that it’s free and open and you’re losing your copyrights, but you’re not. “The discussion is also about social justice, the idea of open access promoting a parity of participation, so everyone has equitable access. "There is also cultural and political dimensions to open access, to actually rewrite material and develop materials thats localised and relevant,” said Cox. Cox added schools currently have access to an open access model called Siyavula which developed textbooks for pupils which has been incorporated into the school curriculum. The platform has saved parents and government a lot of money as the free materials are available in an interactive manner online or in a static pdf or word document, giving schools with low internet connection options to suit their resources. “That’s the flexibility we’re looking for with open text book to make it as accessible as possible. Not all higher education institutes have good wifi access. This is why we’re making the argument for flexibility,” said Cox. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

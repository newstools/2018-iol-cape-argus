The walk, on Sunday, was along Imam Haron Road in Lansdowne The Trust used the event to raise money for its Early Childhood Development programme and for marketing its organisation to the broader community of the Western Cape. The event was sponsored by Bibi’s Kitchen. Fatiema Haron-Masoet, daughter of Imam Haron, said: “Through community participation the Bibi’s Kitchen Family Fun Walk offers the opportunity to increase public awareness of Imam Haron and his legacy as well as exposing the community to the work of the Imam Abdullah Haron Education Trust, thereby expanding our footprint. “We also aim to raise the profile of the late Imam Abdullah Haron, especially to the younger generation, who may not be aware of his role in the liberation struggle through working in marginalised communities that culminated in him making the ultimate sacrifice.” Haron-Masoet said the Early Childhood Development programme is run in partnership with well established and highly respected agencies - Grassroots Educare Trust, the Foundation for Community Work and the Centre for Early Childhood Development. Imam Abdullah Haron, 45, died in police detention on September 27, 1969. There were about 30000 mourners at the funeral. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

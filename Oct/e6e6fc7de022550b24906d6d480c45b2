Pastor Steven Lee Anderson, of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Arizona, has been invited by the People’s Revolutionary Movement (PRM) in South Africa to address a gathering in Durban on 10 November 2018. “We need the pastor to address people on the Role of The Church in the Global Socio-Economic and Political Environment,” says PRM president Nhlanhla Buthelezi. He said the PRM is a political movement that challenges homosexuality, abortion and prostitution in South Africa. “We also protect the existence of kings as chosen by God. We believe that without God’s instructions men cannot change morality.” Anderson was banned by Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba who said the pastor was “identified as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa”. This after more than 60 000 people signed a petition calling for the ban. Meanwhile, Cape Flats Reverend Oscar Bougardt is in the US visiting Anderson and to help him prepare for his trip to South Africa. “The Word of God will be preached and nobody will be able to stop us. His banning to South Africa was a temporary setback,” Bougardt said on Tuesday via email. “Yes, he is still banned, but we’re fighting this behind the scenes. According to our sources, it was illegal for the Minister of Home Affairs to ban him in the first place. “He didn’t break any laws in SA, the minister was under pressure from f*gs so he gave in to them.” Anderson wasn’t available for comment.

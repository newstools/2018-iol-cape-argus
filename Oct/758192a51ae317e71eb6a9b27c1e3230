The handover was part of the “100 Years of Women’s struggles: Women United in Moving South Africa Forward” campaign. Caroline Dunga, 88, a Struggle stalwart and political detainee, participated in the 1956 defiance campaign and marched alongside Dora Tamana. Dunga was living in a dilapidated one-bedroom RDP home. Her plight for a better home was heard by the ANC Women’s League. “It all came as a shock when I receive news that I would be among the first group of military veterans to receive houses,” she said. “I am very excited, because it is a surprise to me. I don’t know what to say, I feel like laughing and crying at the same time,” she said. Kota-Fredericks emphasised that the houses were for ANC military veterans, as well as veterans from other parties. But everything hinged on them being registered on the database of the national Department of Military Veterans.

Kota-Fredericks said the houses were an asset for the veterans. “We hope they will safeguard them for the benefit of their children,” she said. “We are handing over a house to a vulnerable person, who is unable to renovate the house herself, because of her age. This is to say thank you to our veteran,” said Kota-Fredericks. The two-bedroom house has two toilets, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge. Zolani Mbili, a neighbour, said Dunga was everyone’s mother and a pillar in their area. “She always encourages them and shares Struggle stories with them. This is a blessing on its own,” said Mbili. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

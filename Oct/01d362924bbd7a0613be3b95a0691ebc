Education MEC Debbie Schäfer’s spokesperson Jessica Shelver said the department was concerned about matriculants who would begin writing their National Senior Certificate examination today, starting with English Paper 1. Shelver said principals had reported they were already helping pupils with a safe space to study, and study materials. “The district will provide additional resources to schools as required. Our exams directorate has also confirmed that arrangements will be made for the pupils who lost their ID documents in the fire,” she said. “Principals have made contact with the pupil directly. If there are any pupils who require any additional support, they are to please make contact with their school principals.” This was after the devastating fires in Khayelitsha and Kosovo informal settlement, Philippi. The fires left about 1355 people from Khayelitsha and 1400 people from Kosovo, without a roof over their heads. Grade 12 learner Sinovuyo Chithakalo, from Sinethemba High in Philippi, was left traumatised because her school uniform and all her study material was destroyed in the fire in Kosovo informal settlement, Philippi. On Monday, Chithakalo went to school in jeans and a T-shirt. “Today, I’m starting my final matric exams, and that’s really affecting me because some of my books are burnt,” she said. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

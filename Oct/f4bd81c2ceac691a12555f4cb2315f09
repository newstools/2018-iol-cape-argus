The arrested commuter was wearing a golf cap, black leather jacket, black T-shirt, and a grey trousers and in possession of “tik”. Transport and Public Works MEC Donald Grant said that improving security in the rail network and strengthening Metrorail’s ability to provide a safe and reliable service was an urgent priority that demanded the co-operation of all state actors. “I believe that the work we have put into this pilot project to increase Metrorail’s security contingent is a necessary step towards improving passenger rail functionality and effectiveness,” Grant said. “It’s a very important example of intergovernmental co-operation in the interest of society. Improving security will go a long way in restoring commuter faith in the service.” Grant said the Rail Enforcement Unit was assisting the existing security services with challenges the Metrorail service is facing, including sustained attacks on infrastructure and assets, sabotage of the urban rail network, and threats to the safety of commuters and rail employees. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

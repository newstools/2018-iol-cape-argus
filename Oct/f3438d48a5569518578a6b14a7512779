Legislature secretary Gilbert Lawrence said the process was a three-phased process and that consultations were ongoing with senior managers and staff. Last month, the Cape Argus reported on the plan to cut 38 permanent staff members. A report by auditors PwC in July last year said the Western Cape Provincial Parliament consistently had the smallest staff complement of all the legislatures. The report, entitled the Functional Enhancement Project, set out measures to streamline processes and save on staff costs with cuts. Lawrence said they never asked PwC for a renewed staff structure. “We went to PwC to ask for systems to enhance our processes. We will take this report and make our determination. “This is not a definitive document,” he said. Lawrence added that the unions and staff were briefed on several aspects of the report. “Many of the workers complained about several issues. They made these submissions (which are) still being considered” Lawrence said they were currently at phase 3 where they would make decisions. “We will continue to take the process forward but no one is going to lose his or her job,” he said. Speaker Sharna Fernandez said that the aim had always been to effect positive change. “(This is) by identifying opportunities to improve efficiency, to balance the workload, enhance operational processes and ultimately deliver a business that functions optimally.” ANC chief whip Pierre Uys said the presentation lacked substance. “It seemed all over the place. Officials, in some respect, failed to answer questions. We also need the base PwC report to take scrutinise further.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

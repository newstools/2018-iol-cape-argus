He responded with a generous donation of hundreds of shoes for the children of the affected families. On Tuesday, Mayweather visited the area and helped the children try on the shoes while residents were picking up the pieces of their lives, erecting shacks and preparing for their engagement with the Deputy Minister of Human Settlements, Zou Kota-Fredericks, who was joined by the Gift of the Givers. Mayweather is best known for his roles in SWAT: Unit 887 and Furious 7 High Octane. He went to assess the damage in Khayelitsha, and brought hundreds of shoes to donate to the children who were affected by the fire. He said it was heartbreaking to see children suffering because of the devastating fire. “In all the devastation, the uplifting part was to see the community coming together in unity rebuilding their homes,” he said. “It is everyone’s duty and responsibility to take care of the less fortunate. I am so blown away by the number of people that have lost their homes. I really hope we can make a big impact,” Mayweather said He has set up a “gofundme page” on his social media pages for those who wish to assist.    Mayco Committee member for Area South, Eddie Andrews said, there has been an overwhelming response from residents for donations to assist the fire-affected residents. “There is still a need for household items such as blankets, bedding, curtains and clothing,” said Andrews. Andrews said the drop-off points for donations are Wynberg, Khayelitsha and the Strand fire stations. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

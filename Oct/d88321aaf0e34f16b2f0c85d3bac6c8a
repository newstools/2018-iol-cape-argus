Sipho will be performing all of his seminal hits and to usher-in the next generation of hit-makers - all on one stage for one night only. “If you weren't at The Baxter 30 years ago, now it’s your turn,” Mabuse said. “We’ll be doing some riveting performances with some discovered talent from MEX18 (Music Exchange 2018) too.” The night will also feature performances by poet and spoken word artist Siphokazi Jonas and Cape Town treasure and legacy artist Tony Cedras - the Elsies River-born accordion, harmonica, keyboard and guitar player. “I have been privileged to have known Tony for so long,” Mabuse said. “Siphokazi Jonas is an amazing poet. She’s going places.” But why has it taken “Hotstix” so long to return to Cape Town? Part of the reason has been his busy schedule. “Privilege is something else,” he says. “It's a rare gift to be able to take to the stage and still have a room filled with fans who love what you do. I’ve been all over the world, but this Cape Town show feels like a kind of homecoming.” Mabuse has enjoyed a glittering, and constantly evolving career spanning 50 years. And you’ll get to see it all unfold on stage on Friday night. “I’ve always believed I’m an inventive musician,” he says. “You do the hits and misses, it's very important that people experience the creativity in the moment. That's what this show is all about. You're bringing a narrative many people don't realise. "It’s so important in entrenching belief in ourselves that what we make here, at home, has global appeal. Tony’s talent is beyond belief. Fans will see that. I’m excited for us all! “The Baxter holds fond memories. We intend honouring the iconic venue with a stunning one-night show, playing all the hits and throwing in a few surprises along the way too.” Tickets cost R200 to R250 each and the show will run for 90 minutes, with no interval.

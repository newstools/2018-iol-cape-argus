After a sporty opening ceremony on Friday night, featuring the grand master DJ Ready D and singer Jimmy Nevis, the matches kicked off and players brought their A-game. A total of 800 players between seven and 13, from 22 clubs, and making up 80 teams participated. But it was the lunch time shenanigans that had spectators in stitches, as celebrity teams the Media Rock Stars, the Comedian Team, Ex-PSL Legends and FC Kapstadt, went head to head in action-packed matches to find out who has balls of steel. Kenwyn Davids had the tough role of the goalie in the Comedian Team aka The Funky Lemons who wore a bright yellow soccer kit and led by comedian Yaaseen Barnes. “I brought my best defense and managed to save a few goals for my team,” says Kenwyn. Devon Saunders, aka Devdondidit, was on the Media Rock Stars’ team and scored two goals. “These journalists are skillful and superfit, I guess they need to be as they need to run from the tear gas,” he joked. Expresso’s Katlego Maboe also showed off some fancy footwork and impressive headers. In the end, the Media Rock Stars came out tops beating the Comedians 4-2. FC Kapstadt president Zaid Omar says the tournament was another massive success. “We are glad to confirm that we are nailing our vision of providing a platform for grassroots footballers to develop and rise to fame,” he says. @DailyVoiceSA  venecia.america@inl.co.za  Daily Voice

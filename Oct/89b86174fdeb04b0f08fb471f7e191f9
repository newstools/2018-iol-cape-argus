According to the event's Facebook page: "Men’s Conference is a place where the men gather to get inspired, equipped, challenged and refreshed for the future. We truly believe that something significant happens when the men gather. For 2018, we believe that MEN are MADE FOR MORE. God has called YOU for MORE and He wants to do exceedingly above and beyond what you could ever hope for. "We know that every man will leave, feeling empowered, encouraged and excited for the MORE that God has for them!" @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

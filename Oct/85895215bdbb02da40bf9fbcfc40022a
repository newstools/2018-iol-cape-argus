Maggie Rowley, Rabie group spokesperson said Century City Property Owners’ Association confirmed that one of the robbers tied up a security officer and three cleaning staff, and demanded keys for the safe, which the staff didn’t have. “The security officer managed to untie himself and alerted Century City security. Not knowing if anyone was being held by the suspects, they treated the situation as a possible hostage taking. When SAPS arrived they entered the building to search for the suspects. By then the cleaning staff had also untied themselves and left the building to safety.” Hillsong Church said: “We are very thankful that everyone is okay. We are currently also considering additional ways to further ensure the safety of our congregation and staff. The incident has only served to strengthen our resolve to build a church that will help build this nation, which we love, and which we know God loves deeply too.” @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

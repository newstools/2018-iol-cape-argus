About 5000 homeless sleep rough on the streets of Cape Town (compared to the 4500 people in the whole of England) and it is a growing issue largely unnoticed. U-turn recently conducted a survey to understand the public perception of homelessness. More than 80% of Capetonians said homelessness had a negative effect on businesses, neighbourhoods and the larger community. In all, 61% of the public felt that the primary cause of homelessness was unemployment. Furthermore, the cause involves broken families, limited housing for the poor, lack of skills, limited state services, addiction, mental health issues and a criminal record, U-turn Dire or, Sam Vos said: “The survey highlighted a shift in how the public feels about homelessness and there is a growing awareness that a systemic solution is desperately needed to turn back the tide on homelessness.” The organisation has encompassed on a multi-phased programme over the years to provide homeless with skills to overcome homelessness. The public are invited to take part in a “5 Ton Clothing Drive” on October 6 at the Constantia Village Mall from 9am to 5pm. Unused clothing can be dropped off at one of the U-turn stores to help U-turn achieve its goal of collecting five tons of clothing before the end of World Homeless Day.

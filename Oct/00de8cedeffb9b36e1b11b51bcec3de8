The leaders who gathered in Gauteng adopted a resolution on Friday, backing efforts by local church leaders to assist and support shutdown protests across the country. The support call came after several areas in the Cape and Johannesburg were brought to a standstill last week as residents took to the streets to protest violence and crime in their areas. In a statement, the leaders who represents dioceses from across South Africa, said they acknowledge the struggle and pain experienced by communities caught in ongoing cycles of poverty and condemned the lack of effective action by national, provincial and local government. “(We) express specific support for communities in Westbury and on the Cape Flats and the Shutdown Movement in seeking to peacefully protest against the gangsterism flourishing in their communities. “(We) request the archbishop to assure the religious and community leaders and structures on the ground of our prayers and support as they continue to give guidance to these communities in seeking to ensure these crises receive urgent attention by the authorities,” read the statement. The support was welcomed by Western Cape shutdown committee member Henriette Abrahams, who said that the increase in support from organisations across South Africa could result in unrest unfolding in the country. “It's the entire community that is saying enough is enough because it’s the right thing we're campaigning for. It’s time that we as a community take our power back because no one is really fighting for (the) poor on a collective basis,” she said. Abrahams said communities in the Eastern Cape and Northern Cape are taking power into their own hands. She said with voting season coming up, their needs cannot be ignored. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

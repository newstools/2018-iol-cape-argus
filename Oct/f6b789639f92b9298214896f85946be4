This after shots were fired behind Bishop Lavis Secondary School during school hours. Provincial education department spokesperson Jessica Shelver said they received reports of shots fired outside the school. Bishop Lavis community policing forum chairperson Graham Lindhorst said several shootings took place in the area recently. “We hope and pray that these shootings do not disrupt our learners during their exams,” he said. Lindhorst said shootings could take place at any time in the area, and gang violence impacted negatively on pupils. “It creates panic in schools and the community, as parents then call schools, which affects teachers and learners.” A parent, Mary Claasen, said gang shootings in Bishop Lavis severely disrupted teaching and learning at schools. “During the year, pupils were targeted and shot by gangsters,” she said. Her own children’s performance at school suffered due to gang violence. “Sometimes, pupils had to stay away (from school) for about two weeks, and at times those living in the war zones could not attend classes or arrived late,” she said. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the police were aware of the shooting incident that occurred near Bishop Lavis Secondary School. No injuries were reported. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

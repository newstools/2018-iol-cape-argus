Hanover Park Cricket Club has moulded the 16-year-old. Cheslyn, accompanied by his Western Province Learners with Special Needs (LSEN) coach Tobie Sadie, recently travelled to Benoni to compete in the Learners with Special Needs Cricket Week. Cheslyn was crowned the top bowler of the tournament taking 19 wickets. He was then selected for the SA LSEN under-19 school team. Chairperson of the Hanover Park Cricket Club Ashraf Allie said: “We are so proud of his achievement. “Top bowler of the tournament and on one day, they played two T20 games against Boland and Eastern Cape, he took 10 wickets (two stumpings). This is an exciting leg spinner. “We pray that he becomes our first Protea the club produces. Our role is to continue to develop him on and off the field.” Proud mom Anthea Fredericks said: “There’s a lot of talent in Hanover Park and Cheslyn influences the children to do better.” Next month Cheslyn will be playing against an Indian LSEN team, as well as competing in the Coca-Cola Khaya Majola U19 week in December. “Practice hard everyday,” says Cheslyn when asked about his preparations for upcoming tournaments. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The high school, described as a “war zone” because of its dilapidated state, saw angry parents blame the department for deliberately allowing it to fall into disrepair, forcing pupils to attend neighbouring schools they say are already at capacity. The school has just under 100 pupils attending classes and writing their matric exams, as seven teachers take on the duty of educating all pupils as they await the verdict of the court. “We are still waiting on the judge’s decision, and I asked the lawyer about it but he said nothing has happened. There are seven teachers on the staff, one for every subject; some teach two subjects because the department sent no one to help. “The matrics went to Ravensmead and other schools for extra classes. They’ll write at Tygersig school hall, but I can’t say if they will be the last group of matrics. People are still applying for next year,” said Uitsig High governing body member Rosaline Smith. Smith said the school body was hopeful judgment would be issued in their favour, as transport- and gang-related activities were keeping pupils from going to neighbouring schools. Advocate Norman Arendse, who represents the school pro bono, said his office did not know when the judgment would be handed down. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

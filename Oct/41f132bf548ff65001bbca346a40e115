Added to this, speculation is rife that more ward councillors are expected to resign today in support of De Lille. With three days left in office, De Lille is heading to court to set aside the forensic investigation conducted by law firm Bowman Gilfillan into corruption and maladministration at the City. Bowman’s found that De Lille prevented former city manager Achmat Ebrahim from reporting corruption involving MyCiTi buses worth millions and recommended that criminal charges be pursued against De Lille and others. Last week, in a drama-filled day, five DA councillors resigned in theatrical fashion. The exit by these councillors is, according to several sources within the DA and the De Lille camp, paving the way to start work to relaunch the ID. “We know that there are plans to restart the ID. We are aware of these things. We also know who will likely be in the leadership. The ID never died. It stayed open. They have been working on getting the party up again. We also know they have approached funders for electioneering,” the source said. Council chief whip Shaun August resigned in dramatic fashion along with Mayco members for area north Suzette Little and area central Siya Mamkeli, Atlantis councillor Greg Bernado and Mfuleni councillor Thulani van der Stemela. August is a former ID member. The plan, according to highly- placed sources, will be for the ID to be a kingmaker in the Western Cape. Their goal would be to get between 10% to 20% of the vote and should it obtain that support it will support the ANC and EFF to form a coalition with De Lille holding a senior position. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

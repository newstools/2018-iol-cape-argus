The toddler sustained burns to 20% of his body, including his fingers which were burned off in the fire, but doctors at Red Cross War Memorial Hospital (RCWMH) managed to reconstruct stubs where his fingers once were, in order for him to have mobility. Today, 12 years later, Clayton is able to use his left hand to grip a pencil and pick up small stones, but he is still unable to care for himself and faces constant teasing at school for his stub-like fingers. However, this is all about to change. Clayton has been chosen as one of 10 recipients to receive life-changing surgery during a Smile week initiative at RCWMH. The initiative will see Clayton undergoing pioneering surgery when his left thumb will be constructed using his right second toe. This is the second time this ground-breaking paediatric toe-thumb surgery will take place in SA, following the first surgery a month ago. “Clayton is continually teased at school, and relies heavily on his mother, who gave up her job to care for him,” said Smile spokesperson Lisa Kalk. The surgery is expected to take around eight hours. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Tania suffered burns to her back, torso, neck and the side of her face, now 10, she has had multiple reconstructive surgeries. “Thanks to the Smile Foundation and the Vodacom Foundation, a few more children will be gifted the hope of a normal future,” said Dr Gary Dos Passos, head of the Red Cross burn unit. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

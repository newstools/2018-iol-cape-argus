The drivers promised to continue to strike until their grievances were addressed. One of the drivers, Patrick Mabindisa, said: “All we want is to be insourced by the municipality. We are subjected to unfair labour practices in the MyCiTi project. We want fairness like everyone else.” Mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said the Western Cape High Court had granted the City an urgent interdict against the striking workers, preventing them from intimidating, harassing or assaulting MyCiTi passengers and staff, preventing them from damaging MyCiTi stations, depots or buses, and gathering at, or coming closer than 100m to, MyCiTi stations, depots or buses. “We trust the strikers will abide by the order and will stop intimidating and threatening their colleagues who are not participating in the wildcat strike that has been orchestrated by the Economic Freedom Fighters. “I want to state upfront that I have been available all week to address the striking workers, but on the condition that this engagement happens through their legitimate representatives, namely the unions who represent the employees in the workplace. “I will not engage with striking workers through the EFF, who are desperate to establish themselves as brokers in an environment where they do not belong and where they have no legitimate mandate. “We are monitoring the situation and will update commuters accordingly,” he said. Herron said monthly ticket holders would be reimbursed. Contact the Transport Information Centre at all hours on 0800 6564 63. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

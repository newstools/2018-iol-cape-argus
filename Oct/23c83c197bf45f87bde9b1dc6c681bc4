The report indicated that informal dwellings remained a cause for concern for municipalities due to the substantial cost to provide free basic services. There were health risks, with children exposed to bad living conditions and crime. The average number of people per household within planning districts in the Cape metro has remained stable at about four persons per household over the last decade. “I want to reiterate that everything that we are doing is geared towards reversing the legacy of apartheid spatial planning and the transformation of Cape Town’s spatial form to promote transport-oriented development and to provide affordable and inclusionary housing on well-located land close to public transport and job opportunities,” Herron said. Social Justice Coalition’s co-head of programmes, Musa Gwebani, said: “What the City does not understand is that there are other alternative ways to provide housing; for example, initiate integrated housing in the inner City.” Gwebani added that there were many reasons why people lived in informal dwellings, the crux of which was that renting had become unregulated. “That is the main reason pushing people out into the streets, and the high cost of living has forced people to occupy land because they can’t afford rent any more,” said Gwebani. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

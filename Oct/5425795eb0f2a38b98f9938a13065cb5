The Kite Festival has been presented in support of Cape Mental Health since 1994. The event will take place at the Zandvlei Estuary Nature Reserve in Muizenberg from 10am to 6pm. Entry is R40 per person (and R15 for children 12 and younger). A kite can be bought at the festival or can be created at the free kite-making workshops for children and adults. Cape Mental Health aims to improve social practices that affect the mental health of people, which supports about 19 000 individuals annually. “Rise Up is our theme for 2018,” said Ingrid Daniels, director of Cape Mental Health and president elect of the World Federation for Mental Health. “We believe everyone is born with potential to rise up beyond life’s circumstances. Our mission and the services we provide help people realise this potential and overcome mental health challenges they may encounter. Kites are one of the tools we use. “Almost everyone feels inspired when they simply lift their heads and look up.” There will be various international kiters including: Kevin & Linda Sanders, Peter Hulcoop, Phil & Carly Broder, Ralf & Lucas Maserski, Sandesh & Geeta Kaddi and professional South African kiters including: Bobby Gathoo, Brian & Beryl Skinner, Ebrahim Sambo, Gerald Gelderbloem, Greg Mountjoy, Ian & Jenny Islip and Mari Ware-Lane. There will also be a tea garden, food trucks, fairground rides and there will be a children zone for the kids to play with supervision.

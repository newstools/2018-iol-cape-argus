Many of these will be hosted on the African continent for the first time. Julie-May Ellingson, chief executive officer of the CTICC, said the bids were testament to the CTICC’s competitiveness as a venue and Cape Town’s attractiveness as a business event destination. “These wins do not happen without the concerted effort of the CTICC team and the dedicated collaboration between internal and external stakeholders, including the Western Cape Convention Bureau and City of Cape Town.” She added that the CTICC’s key objective was to connect people to create jobs. “The bids won will assist the CTICC in achieving this across a wide range of key economic sectors and reflects the centre’s ability to contribute meaningfully to the Cape Town, Western Cape and South African economy.” Among the major events that are to be held is the general assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Professor Patrick Woudt, who was instrumental in bringing the event to Cape Town, said Africa was undergoing a tremendous growth in astronomy with the establishment of the Southern African Large Telescope, the MeerKAT radio telescope array. “Hosting the IAU general assembly will bring the world of astronomy to Africa, to South Africa and to Cape Town. There is a long and rich history of astronomy in South Africa, dating back to the establishment of the observatory in Cape Town in 1820; they will celebrate their 200th anniversary in 2020.” @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

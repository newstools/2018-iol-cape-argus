It’s a rare opportunity as it has been three decades since the iconic musician has performed at the theatre, coupled with the fact that he will perform on Friday night only. And the good news is that Mabuse will be joined by two other legends: poet/writer/performer Siphokazi Jonas and Cape Town jazz maestro Tony Cedras. Jonas is no stranger to the stage: a writer and performer, she has produced four one-woman poetry shows, both in the Mother City and in Joburg. Says Mabuse: “Siphokazi Jonas is an amazing poet. She’s going places.” She holds a master's degree in English literature as well as a BA degree in drama and English. The talented performer has been a featured act at poetry sessions and festivals around the country, and her considerable experience means she has been top of the list when it comes to judging poetry slam competitions. Renowned musicians Freshly­ground, Pops Mohamed, Dizu Plaatjies and Dave Reynolds are on the list of top musos she has teamed up with in sought-after concerts. In 2016, Jonas made history as the first African poet to perform at Rhetoric in Los Angeles - referred to as the biggest Christian spoken-word event in the world. Until recently, she worked as a teaching assistant at UCT and lectured part-time on South African literature and oral poetry. Now she runs writing and performance workshops for children and adults as part of her Page to Podium series, and is also a guest teacher of the spoken word and performance at a primary school in Gainesville, Florida. Tickets to Friday night’s show cost R200 to R250 each, and the show will run for 90 minutes with no interval.

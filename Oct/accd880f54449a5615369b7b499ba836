Maher is the biggest name in the Islamic music genre and has over 1.8 billion views for his music videos. He has released three albums with Thank You Allah (2009) being internationally acclaimed. “Following our collaboration with Inner Circle Entertainment in the Symphony of Ghazal two years ago, we are delighted to perform with Maher Zain, said Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra’s chief executive Louis Heyneman. Maher will be accompanied by his international band of musicians from Egypt, Spain, Lebanon, Belgium, Netherlands and the UK. “Showcasing international musicians such as Zain, meets the CPO’s goal to expand its reach beyond symphony concerts, opera, ballet, musicals and school concerts to meeting new audiences in crossover concerts that appeal to a wider spectrum of communities.” For more information visit www.computicket.com or contact the Computicket Call Centre on 0861 915 8000. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

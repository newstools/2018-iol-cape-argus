Residents were salvaging building material from the fire and using building kits they received from the municipality to rebuild their homes. They were also given food. The fire ripped through the area on Thursday. Community leader Simbongile Nongwane said some families had lost all their belongings and need food. “We are thankful to everyone donating to us,” Nongwane said, adding that the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) Gift of the Givers SA Red Cross Society, Shoprite, Pick n Pay and some supermarket retailers were assisting them. Nongwane said these families were sleeping outside because there is no hall in their area. He said the fire department was unable to gain access due to the lack of infrastructure.

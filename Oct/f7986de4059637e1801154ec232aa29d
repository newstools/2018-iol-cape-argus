On Monday, the 17-year-old, who cannot be named, appeared at the juvenile court in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court with 21-year-old co-accused Adrian Carelse. The two face a charge of murder. The teen was transferred to a place of safety, while Carelse will be held at Pollsmoor Prison. The teen has applied for a Legal Aid SA representative, while his co-accused will hire a private lawyer. The case was postponed to November 15. Noordien was caught in a gang crossfire shooting in Hanover Park. The arrest followed Police Anti-Gang Unit operations where members were deployed to areas such as Hanover Park, Lavender Hill and Bonteheuwel in an intervention to fight gang violence and its manifestations. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said the deployments had yielded successes such as the arrest of Noordien’s alleged killers. “A 21-year-old suspect was arrested for the murder of Gift of the Givers volunteer Ameeroodien Noordien after he handed himself over to Philippi police in response to being pursued by police officials. “A second suspect in the Noordien case was arrested. “The 17-year-old was arrested on Athburg Walk, Hanover Park, by members of the Anti-Gang Unit,” added Potelwa. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

A Shawco vehicle with a giant inflatable heart drove along Jakes Gerwel Drive, Beach Road at the Waterfront and finally to the Grand Parade, where the heart was inflated and put on display for the entire day. Shawco was established in 1943 and is still one of the largest organisations of its kind, providing services to the community. They assist approximately 4 000 patients and almost 2 000 learners, with free venues for students to study, free tuition, free health care services, and free computer training. Its educational programme has provided 1 300 learners with academic help. Shawco also introduced the Blue Monday campaign in order to shift the heavy-hearted feelings that come with a Monday, to more positive and hopeful feelings, explains Gavin Joachims, director of Shawco. The blue colour is associated with doing something positive in society. “We are coming out today to spread social consciousness and we actually want to say to people that there are ways of donating and helping people who are needy, because there are so many people who need support and assistance,” says Candice Daniels. There are many organisations aiming to uplift communities in different ways and the Blue Monday campaign hopes to spread the idea of helping communities across Cape Town. “There are other NGOs that need support, we want to encourage people to look at what these organisations are doing, and we also want people to help communities,” said Joachims. There was also a 75-hour campaign which is parallel with the 75-year anniversary, where events and activities were taking place throughout the university to raise awareness. @Sukainaish  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

This is according to the SA Weather Service as the Western Cape experiences a scorching heat wave, with some regions recording exceptionally high temperatures. Lauren Smith, a forecaster for the SA Weather Service, explained: “A heat wave occurs when there are three consecutive days with a maximum temperature that is to be more or equal to five degrees higher than the average maximum of the hottest month for that particular town.” The hottest location in the province is understood to be Slangrivier with 40°C. Smith said no rain was predicted for the next seven days but cooler weather was expected from Monday. “On Thursday there will be a temporary break in the heat wave, but from Friday to Sunday there is a possibility for another heat wave to occur over the Cape metropole. On Monday, cooling is expected. “It’s too soon to predict the impact of the high temperatures on the winter season. But everyone should continue their efforts in saving water for the future," Smith added. ER24 Emergency Medical Care advises everyone to be aware of the effects of the heat as they can be severe. @michewanders  miche.edwards@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

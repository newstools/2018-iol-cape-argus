Host club FC Kapstadt was impressive as usual, grabbing the Under-9 and Under-13 Championship titles. The club took home the Bienie Alexander Cup (under-13 championship) and the team’s captain Lut Hartley took home the under-13 Reggie Jantjies Award (Player of the Tournament). Maitland-based FN Rangers FC beat former champions Camps Bay FC 1-0 in an intense CTTFA derby match to lift the Under-10 Championship Trophy. Esther Jantjies, the wife of former Bafana Bafana midfielder Reggie Jantjies was on hand to present the various age group Reggie Jantjies Award. The former Hellenic and Cape Town Spurs star passed away three weeks ago. FC Kapstadt president Zaid Omar said: “Firstly we are grateful to our partners Lucky Star, JIVE, City of Cape Town, Good Hope FM and NL Print for their commitment to the event and in stepping up to provide a platform for grassroots sport, which is the most important phase of any athlete.” Since its introduction last year, the Kapstadt CUP Celebrity Challenge proved to be extremely popular once again. The exhibition part of the festival started with a moment of silence in honour of Reggie Jantjies. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

“It was such a shock and a relief, because I had been misdiagnosed twice by doctors.” He only got the news last month and on hearing of his predicament, staff at the station jumped to support him. The staff of Magic 828 will be hosting a charity event to raise funds for him and his family. The event will be held at the Magic Studio on the November 2 and will start at 5pm, tickets at R200. The event is also to raise awareness on the importance of this life-threatening cancer, as it becomes more prevalent today, among the youth. There will be a spit braai and the funds raised from the event will be used to assist MacDonald and his family with treatments and medical support. “If you know there is something wrong with your body then I encourage everyone to get regular check-ups and make an effort to see a doctor and also get a second opinion.” “Individuals should also find out their family history because they can also become more aware of whether they are vulnerable to inheriting any types of cancers,” said Mac Donald. Byron’s father, Edward, said the family is trying to stay positive. “We are all trying to be as positive as possible and as a family we are providing him with all the love and we believe that he will get through it. Financially it will be a strain on everyone but we will get together and get through it,” he said “We could see he was in a lot of discomfort, as the pain increased over the space of days. We suggested he see a doctor, as his condition was visibly deteriorating When the results of his MRI scan came back, Byron received the devastating news that he has stage 4 colon cancer,” said Tabitha Kirstein, a work colleague of MacDonald. “Byron is an incredibly positive person and although he delivered his news in tears, he still smiled and told us he is going to beat this,” said Kirstein. * For tickets or donations, please email nadiah@magic828.co.za or call 073 2055 251. @Sukainaish  sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

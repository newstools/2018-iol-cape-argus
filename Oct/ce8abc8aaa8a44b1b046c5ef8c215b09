She said the play was based on her days as a child growing up in District Six and being forcibly removed to live in Hanover Park. Salie found “10 talented individuals” from areas such as Hanover Park, Woodstock, Kewtown, Bo-Kaap and District Six “to create positive change among youth”. They are Fatima Arnold, Tyrone Pharo, Lecrecia Lewis, Clinton van Harte, Waahid Gabriels, Dean Scheepers, Talgeeh Isaacs, Thameenah Dramat, Abdul-Muizz Basardien and Shireen Bantom. “It was a great challenge finding these young talented people and finding sponsors after I had already invested much in the play, ” she said .

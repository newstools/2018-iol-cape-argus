Cape Town -Â  Crime scene investigators have cordoned off Calvalcade Road in Green Point where a top advocate was assassinated while dropping his son off at Reddam private school on Tuesday morning. Pete Mihalik, who is well known for representing underworld criminal figures, was shot dead shortly before 8am. His eight-year-old son was injured in the shooting and rushed to hospital. Neighbours and shocked parents milled around in Thornhill Road where Mihalik's dark grey Mercedes could be seen with a bullet hole through the passenger window, despite anti-hijacking film. One man, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had heard two gunshots. In a police statement, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said detectives from the anti-gang unit and SAPS crime scene experts were combing the scene for clues.  Rwexana said Mihalik, 50, was shot in the head and the suspect was seen "fleeing the scene in a metallic grey VW Polo". A parent, who did not want to be identified, said he drove down Calvalcade Road to drop off his daughter, a few minutes after the shooting but thought there had been an accident.  The school was placed on lockdown and no parents were allowed past the police cordons. African News Agency (ANA)

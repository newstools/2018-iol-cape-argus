The descendants of the Filipino community still inhabit the area, yet the only indicator of their historic journey to the Cape was a single tombstone at the top of Boyes Drive, which served as the resting place of the Filipino settlers. However, on Sunday the steps leading to the cemetery were honoured by Executive Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson, Philippine Ambassador Joseph Angeles and the Kalk Bay Historical Association, who renamed the steps Manila Steps. The previously unnamed steps, on the corner of Quarterdeck and Kimberley roads, were renamed to honour the Filipino fishermen who contributed to the fishing community and culture present in the area today. “The Filipinos were known for being excellent fishermen, and became part of the growing community in Kalk Bay whose livelihood depended on both fishing and whaling. The naming of the Manila Steps recognises the history and influence of the Filipino community in Kalk Bay,” said Neilson. An information board was unveiled at the bottom of the steps to mark the occasion and share more details on the history of the Filipino community. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

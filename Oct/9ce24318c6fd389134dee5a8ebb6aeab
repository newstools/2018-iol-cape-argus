“They really want to go to school and we don’t know what to tell them anymore,” Badronessa Morris said. Many of the children are still in primary school with the oldest in matric. “One of the children here is suppose to be writing final exams, but he can’t because his books and study guides are in Blikkiesdorp.” Information advocacy group Right2Know’s Allison Tilley said: “We are deeply concerned about the fact that these children are missing out on school, especially with exams coming up.” Tilley said they were looking into finding a solution. The residents were forced to flee their homes in Blikkiesdorp just two weeks ago after violence erupted in the area. Community Safety MEC Dan Plato said: “We have been frequently engaging with the community and we are looking into this. “But our main priority at the moment is to ensure that safety is restored in the area once that has been restored then we can focus on the other issues.” Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said: “The WCED was not made aware of the displacement and principals have also not reported any pupils that have been de-registered from this area. The WCED will make contact with the schools to find out more information. It is also not quite clear if this is a temporary measure. The pupils will need to be placed in schools where they will reside and sadly, it seems that this is unclear at this stage where they will reside permanently. The WCED will, however, follow up with the schools concerned.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

SAHRC Commissioner Chris Nissen said some of the drivers’ problems remained a “massive and ongoing challenge” and that he would ask Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to intervene. Nissen said some of their issues were labour related and some needed the public protector. He said he would consult all parties involved and find out the “legitimacy and truth” before he took the matter further. MyCiTi bus services are expected to operate the same today as on Tuesday, mayco member for Transport and Urban Development Brett Herron said . He said the services were expected to operate as follows: TPI-inner-City service was operating at 31% during the on-peak period and 58% during the off-peak period. TBRT service operated at 80% during the on-peak period and at 64% during the off-peak period due to the reduced number of drivers. This service includes Atlantis routes numbers 104, 106, 114, 116, 232/244, 234, 236, 237, 241, 242, 243 and 246 T02. N2 Express service between Khayelitsha and Mitchell Plain and the Cape Town Civic Centre operated 100% during on- and off-peak periods Kidrogen, the Table View and Dunoon services operated at 67% during the on-peak period and 50% during the off-peak period. This service includes route numbers T04, D08, 208, 260, 235, 214, 215, 216 and 223. Herron said, “I want to thank the workers who continue to operate in the face of intimidation and threats to ensure that our commuters are not completely stranded.” One of the drivers, Luzuko Memani said, “This matter is beyond their control and needs powerful organisations to intervene. We consulted the SAHRC and the ANC to intervene.” He said they were “not turning back”. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

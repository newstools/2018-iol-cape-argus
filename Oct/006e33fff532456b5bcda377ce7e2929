Suzanne Lambert’s supervisor and senior lecturer in water quality at UCT, Dyllon Randall, said the concept of using urea to grow bricks was tested in the US years ago, using synthetic solutions. However, Lambert’s brick uses real human urine, with significant consequences for recycling ­and upcycling. Randall said: “The bio-bricks are created through a natural process called microbial carbonate precipitation, not unlike the way seashells are formed. Loose sand is colonised with bacteria that produce urease. The urease breaks down the urea in urine while producing calcium carbonate through a chemical reaction. This cements the sand into any shape, whether a solid column or, now for the first time, a rectangular building brick.” He said the development is good news for the environment and global warming because bio-bricks are made in moulds at room temperature. Regular bricks are kiln-fired at temperatures around 1400°C and produce vast quantities of carbon dioxide. In addition, the bio-brick process produces nitrogen and potassium as a by-product, which are components of commercial fertilisers. Randall said, chemically speaking, urine was liquid gold, as it accounted for less than 1% of domestic waste water but contained 80% of the nitrogen, 56% of the phosphorus and 63% of the potassium of this waste water. Up to 97% of the phosphorus in the urine can be converted into calcium phosphate, the key ingredient in fertilisers. He said this is significant because the world’s natural phosphate reserves are running dry. The scheme would result in zero waste, with the urine converted into three useful products. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

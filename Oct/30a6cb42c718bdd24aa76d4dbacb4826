Members of a life-saving Cape Town Fire department team went up against 30 vehicle extrication teams and 24 trauma teams from around the globe that participated in the World Rescue Challenge in Athlone on Tuesday. The teams completed various tasks, including rescuing an injured person from a crushed vehicle and helping those needing medical assistance using various skills and tools in a bid to win top honours in trauma response and vehicle extraction challenges. Mayco member for Safety, Security and Social Services, JP Smith, said Cape Town had entered the challenge for the second time, and the team hoped to improve their ranking after coming 28th out of 34 teams in Romania last year. “These rescue teams are all impressive, and are the best at what they do, which is to save lives. During the challenge they have an opportunity to show what they do and to test themselves against their peers from around the globe. “They are also able to share techniques and learn from each other,” said Smith.

Divisional commander in the Fire and Rescue Service and team manager, Arlene Wehr, agreed with Smith and said the local teams, the Cape Town Destroyers and Cape Town Twominators, were excited to demonstrate their skills. “We formed in 2012 and have represented the City in Brazil and Romania. They are excited to show their skills this year. “The guys really put in hard work, so we’ll do our best. We won the national challenge last year, and this is the world’s best,” said Wehr. The competition is hosted by the World Rescue Organisation, which aims to help share emergency rescue and medical techniques, practices and procedures. The challenge will finish on Friday at the Athlone stadium. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

E-learning, which will be rolled out at all schools over the next five years at a cost of R1.2billion, makes use of smart boards, tablets and cellphones, but these have proven a distraction in some classrooms. Cedars High school principal David Charles said the use of cellphones in class had resulted in issues with concentration because some pupils used their devices to create distractions. “Teachers give the pupils instructions and they do their research on their phone, but they go on social media and get distracted or put on music and use earphones” Mount View High school teacher, Reginald Assur, agreed with Charles that some pupils swayed from using their phones for work-related purpose, but said the technology had proven more valuable than not, because pupils’ concentration had increased. Marketing manager at Eiffel Corp, Clare Reilly, said many issues regarding e-learning stems from the misconception of what e-learning is and the inability of teachers to adapt lessons to a digital format. She said the company realised it needed to ensure teachers knew how to use the technology. Education department spokesperson Jessica Shelver said the department would ensure all schools and teachers were equipped to handle the devices. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

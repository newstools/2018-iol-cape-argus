Mdzananda Animal Clinic, home to about 400 000 people and their pets, will be hosting its first Downward Facing Adopt-A-Dog event on October 27 in De Waal Park. Yoga instructor Lee-Ann Elliot will lead the class into a one-hour gentle flow class guided by the live acoustic music of Tombstone Pete. The event was brought about after the clinic received an immense amount of homeless dogs in September. Being an NPO, the clinic is not fully equipped to house and assist stray dogs, but have expressed that they will not turn away a pet in need. Fund-raising and communications manager for the clinic Marcelle du Plessis said: “Our animal hospital serves up to 700 Khayelitsha pets per month through consultations, hospitalisation, surgery, including sterilisation, general and orthopaedic, mobile clinics and an animal ambulance.” The event was created with the aim of bringing dogs to an easy accessible location where dog lovers can meet them and enjoy a yoga class. “Many people are too scared to visit our organisation, as we are based in Khayelitsha. This makes it more difficult for us to find homes for pets.” The yoga class will begin at 11.30am, but it is advised that all arrive at De Waal Park around 11am to get a good spot. Don’t forget to bring along a yoga mat or a towel, as well as family and friends who are on the lookout for a new furry friend. The cost of the class is donation-based and all funds raised will go to the Mdzananda Animal Clinic.

This was the second donation, with the first donation being given to the Animal Welfare Society. Twizza donated bottled water to several homeless shelters across the city on World Homeless Day last week. The water range from Twizza is mineral enriched and prepared by using the latest reverse-osmosis process. Reverse osmosis is a water purification technology that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules and larger particles from drinking water. Twizza Soft Drinks was founded by Ken Clark in 2003. In 2012, another facility was opened near Middelburg. Besides producing pure mineral- enriched water that tastes good, the factory is 25% more efficient on power due to the state-of-the-art technology being used. Twizza is much more than just water. They have a large selection of soft drinks available. Weeks before the World Homeless Day events that have been hosted across the city, the Dignity Project was informed of this much-needed commodity. Due to logistics such as space, which was taken care of, five organisations that work with the homeless received water. Each beneficiary's water was delivered directly to the address of the organisation. With dams running on empty not so long ago and people queueing to collect water from collection points, it made us all aware of how fragile the water situation is. More than 70% of our bodies consist of water, and drinking around eight glasses a day is widely recommended by doctors and nutritionists worldwide. @masekind3213  danny.oosthuizen@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

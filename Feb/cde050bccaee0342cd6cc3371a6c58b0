Hundreds of youth spent their Sunday picking up litter on the streets of Bellville. One of the volunteers, Fezeka Dyushu, said they were raising awareness about climate change through their different campaigns. “During the week the area has a high density of people and litter accumulates. The Voortrekker Road Corridor Improvement District company which usually cleans the area permitted us to clean it. Our current campaign, We Are One, is educating young people to take care of their surrounding environment and people. It instils these qualities, which will enable them to be future leaders,” Dyushu said. The group of 120 volunteers collected about 200 bags filled with litter within 3 hours. “We are office and college students standing up against the global trash problem and cleaning up waste, making it the biggest positive civic action," Dyushu said. "We also aim to unite the global community to achieve our final goal: a clean and healthy planet. Another volunteer, Yunsol Bae, said: "Many people watched us and took pictures, so through this we could bring awareness, and introduce the church to many passers-by. "We are able to show the spirit of love and spread the love.” The church is also recognised internationally for other volunteer activities such as donating blood and social welfare. Among the 2000 awards the church has received is the Queen’s Award.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

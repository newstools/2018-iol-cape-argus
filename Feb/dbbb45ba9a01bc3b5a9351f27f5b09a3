Early on Sunday morning his office was broken into when burglars entered through the back of the office where they had broken the burglar bars. “I rushed to the office after I received a phone call informing me about what had happened. It’s rather sad that this happened to the centre of service delivery. One of the greatest concerns I have is not the theft of property including computers, cables and phones but rather the fact that service delivery will be hampered,” McKenzie said. He said Monday was frustrating as everything stood still as police were busy. “My files and documents were also a mess; I’m not sure what has been taken, I’ll only see as time goes by. I don’t see this as a personal attack because when you are active and dealing with pressing issues such as crime, you can expect threats. “They need to understand they are not hurting me but the community they live in and it will not deter me from rendering service,” McKenzie said. He said they have received a tip-off already and authorities were aware of the threats and incidents. Two weeks ago the councillor had to run for his life in Bonteheuwel when gunmen opened fire on him, while he was standing at the scene of an earlier shooting in which a man was shot dead. In another incident last year in September, he was hospitalised after he got into a fight with a suspect who broke into his house and bit him. When he arrived at his Parow home shortly after 7am  he saw a man throwing his children’s bikes over the gate to steal them.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Jim opened a cycling academy back in 2016 at the Masiphumelele township in Fish Hoek. “I have seen how cycling has changed my life. I come from a very poor community and I know what goes on in townships, where there are drugs, alcohol and abuse, and the main reason is to take kids away from those situations,” he said. Jim is originally from the Eastern Cape and was named the first black South African rider to complete the 2015 Vuelta a Espana race. Currently he has around 35 youngsters between the ages of 10 and 22 in his academy. “I’ve always been fascinated with cycling and when I decided to do my first competition, I wanted to get the experience. But it wasn’t an easy ride due to financial constraints. “Getting funds was the most challenging part of all of this because we have such limited bikes available for the children, which was challenging.” But it was generous donors from the Cape Town Cycle Tour who sponsored him with race entries for the academy. A few years ago, Jim received a donation of 15 bicycles from a Dutch organisation, and that has kick-started his academy. “I want to give opportunities to our children so that they can be successful in life, and through studying and riding bikes.” While he is working on finding a new team to race with, he is in desperate need of more bicycles, helmets and spare parts.

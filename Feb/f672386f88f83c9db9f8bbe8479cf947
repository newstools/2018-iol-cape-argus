The schools included Schotsche Kloof Primary School, Cecil Road Primary School and Zonnebloem Boys and Zonnebloem Girls primary schools. The schools had already prepared and booked the venue, but had to turn back when it was locked with a notice from the fire chief at the gate. Asa Sallie, whose grandson was going to participate for the first time, said she was very upset as the children were looking forward to the day. Sallie said the note said it was due to safety reasons that the stadium was closed. “They said it was because a sheet from the roof had blown off and it was not safe for the children. This roof has been blown off since December and the whole of last week there was athletics up to Tuesday. “They are holding our children back because from here they go to zonals, then Western Province and eventually SA Sports, but now we will never know.” Schotsche Kloof Primary principal Faazil Kamish said the pupils were very disappointed, as it was a day they looked forward to each year. “The children had to come back to school and we had to occupy them, as some of them were not prepared to come to school. They were extremely disappointed because they trained so hard and were excited to showcase their talents. “We used money for things like buses, portaloos, first aid, security and T-shirts that were printed for the pupils for the day.There was no prior notice given to us.” Zonnebloem Boys Primary School principal Deon May shared similar sentiments. “Some of the parents took a day or half day off from work and were going to fetch their children from the stadium, but we had to make calls for them to be collected at school.” He said they are now trying to negotiate another time that the athletics day can be held. “We are hoping to get another date somewhere before March.” The City did not respond to calls for comment.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Although delays were still experienced, no major incidents were reported and unions and commuters welcomed the restoration of the service. Cosatu Western Cape secretary Tony Ehrenreich said the limited service was not enough. He said issues of security and infrastructure still needed to be attended to. “Only a few trains are restored and they’re shorter carriages, so they may be making the situation worse. Now that people know the line has been restored, they’re returning to the trains which will have overcrowded carriages, putting lives at risk. “They’re not doing the commuters any favours. They need to put out additional buses so that when the lines are shut again, they can commission the buses. The service is less than 50% of what people pay for; they should be given half their money back,” said Ehrenreich. United National Transport Union (Untu) general secretary Steve Harris also welcomed the return of the service, but said that the additional security measures implemented on the Central Line needed to be implemented nationally as well. This comes after two train drivers were attacked at Koedoespoort Station in Pretoria Wednesday due to train delays. “Untu demands that Prasa must implement the drastic security measures, which have now been implemented on the notorious Central Line in the Western Cape after the services were suspended for the past five weeks, on all the railway lines. “Unfortunately, Prasa and the South African Police Service have allowed the railway line to become such a wa rzone that drastic expensive measures are needed nationwide to bring back law and order to our passenger railway system,” said Harris. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said an assessment of the Central Line would be available later on Thursday. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

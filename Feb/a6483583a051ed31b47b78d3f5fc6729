Aziza Nolan, founder of Peace Home - a home for abused and abandoned children - said their home was one of the safety nets for these children. She said they believed drugs and the increase in young parents were some of the reasons children were being neglected. “Neglect and abuse don’t discriminate and children of any race are affected.” She said children as young as three months had been left abandoned on the streets. Just last month a 33-year-old mother was arrested for child neglect in Table View. The mother was arrested after leaving her two-year-old daughter unattended in a shopping trolley on Blaauwberg Road. Police spokesperson Adriana Chandler said the situation was reported to the police by a concerned citizen who found the child in the hot sun. “When the officers took the child to the police station, to contact social services, they first took the little girl to TLC, which is situated on the grounds of the police station. “The founder, Colleen Petersen, then informed the officers that the mother was in fact there with them.” Chandler said when the mother was questioned she contradicted herself and was then arrested and charged with child neglect. “The woman contradicted herself, because she told (Petersen) another version of where the child was. “The little girl was handed over to the Department of Social Services.” Department spokesperson, Sihle Ngobese said the department had a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the abuse, neglect or abandonment of children. “The public can report any cases of child neglect and/or abuse to their nearest department local office, or by calling the hotline on 0800220250.”  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

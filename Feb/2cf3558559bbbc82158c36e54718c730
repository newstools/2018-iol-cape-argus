Police spokesperson Andrè Traut confirmed that a complaint of bribery and corruption was lodged at Cape Town Central police station on Friday. “The circumstances are under investigation and no one has been charged as yet. Kindly be advised that the identities of the parties concerned cannot be disclosed,” he said. The DA lodged corruption and bribery charges against De Lille. The charges relate to alleged attempts to solicit a R5m bribe from a businessman from Gauteng in 2012. De Lille has said she has not been formally notified of these charges by the police. “Should criminal charges have been laid against me, I will co-operate openly and transparently with the SAPS. I deny and reject the reported allegations with the contempt they deserve. The timing of this latest move raises many questions such as why this man, Anthony Faul, is conveniently coming forward now when the DA is charging me for other matters. “Firstly, why did he go to the DA first, instead of going to the police? Why did he wait almost five years to make these allegations?” De Lille asked. “This seems to be the latest of a string of moves to taint my name by clutching at anything and informing the media before allegations are properly tested. I have repeatedly asked for a fair process yet the handling of this matter and the treatment towards me are clearly attempts to sway public perception against me instead of giving me a fair opportunity to state my case and to test the allegations properly.” DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela referred all queries to James Selfe, the party’s federal executive chairperson, who did not respond to messages sent to him. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

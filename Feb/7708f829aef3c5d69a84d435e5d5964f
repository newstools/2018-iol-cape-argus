The incident occurred on Saturday in Peter Charles Street, Cafda. Ward councillor Shanen Rossouw said she received a phone call around 9.30pm, but could only go and see the extent of damage on Sunday. “According to the fire victims, the alleged perpetrator, an unemployed resident, was burning his rubbish. He had gone into his house thinking that the fire had calmed, but strong winds fuelled the fire. "When I visited the families I saw three shacks were gutted and a formal house was also destroyed.” She said the families lost everything in the fire, but they slept at relatives' homes and she would try get them assistance. Allister Hendricks, a resident, said if he didn't act fast he would have been a victim. “We were sitting outside with my neighbour and someone told us a nearby shack was burning. We went to check and the fire was spreading fast and almost by our shacks. I managed to remove everything from inside my house, unfortunately my neighbour lost everything. His children don't have school uniforms, they are only left with what they were wearing.”  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Steenkamp’s cousin and chief executive of the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation, Kim Martin, said that every day since Reeva’s death had been hard to bear for the entire family, but yesterday was particularly tough. “A day focused on celebrating those you love is especially difficult. It takes us straight back to the day that Reeva was taken from us. Every year the family go down to the beach to scatter roses into the sea. “It has been a tradition ever since the anniversary of Reeva’s death and the family do it no matter where they are in the world,” said Martin. Martin thanked the public on behalf of the family for their special messages and love received over this time. “We are honoured to continue Reeva’s wish to empower and educate women and children against abuse through the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation,” said Martin. @IAmAthinaMay  athin.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

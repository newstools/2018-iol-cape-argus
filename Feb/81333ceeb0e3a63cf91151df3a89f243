De Lille on Monday evening tweeted portions of a letter sent by her legal team to federal executive chairperson James Selfe. Anthony Faul, a Gauteng businessman, alleged that De Lille had sought R5million from him for endorsing his product a fire extinguisher that he was marketing to use in informal settlements in the city. The endorsement was allegedly withdrawn when he refused to pay. Faul's claim dates back to 2013. The allegation resulted in a case being opened against De Lille by the DA which police are investigating. De Lille’s lawyer’s letter states that De Lille was sent a copy of Faul’s affidavit on January 30 and informed that this would form the basis of a charge against her, but that she would be given the chance to respond. Her lawyers, however, argued that the publication of the information in the weekend press displayed a prejudice against her. “We are instructed (by De Lille) that the DA had maliciously and with the intention to cause our client maximum reputation damage caused the contents of the Faul affidavit to be published in the media. “The DA has caused criminal charges to be laid against our client based on the contents of the affidavit in circumstances where it must be clear that the allegations as contained in the affidavit are untested and more so uncorroborated” the letter states. Her lawyers said she was reserving her rights to take “appropriate action against the DA and Faul”. A no confidence motion against De Lille will take place on February 15. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

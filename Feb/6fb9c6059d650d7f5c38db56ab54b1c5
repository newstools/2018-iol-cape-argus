The Valhalla Park teen was laid to rest in 2016, following her gruesome murder, and her grieving father says he is willing to give his last to pay for a tombstone over her grave, which he says has been vandalised numerous times. Charl Moore, 54, says whenever they visit the site at Maitland Cemetery, they have to fix it. “My child is already dead, now she can't even get to rest in peace,” he says. “Our family is still struggling to go on after her death. Her grave has been vandalised countless times and it’s not a nice feeling having to visit her, which is already hard enough, and still see that the flowers have been stolen or the mat she had over her grave is missing or her grave is unrecognisable.” Visit The dad says he tries to visit every second week. “Every time we just have to erect her gravestone again so it can look decent,” a heartbroken Charl says. Lekita, 18, was murdered in September 2016. She was stabbed 98 times, while her breasts, nipples and vaginal area were slashed. Her naked and mutilated body was found dumped on an open field in Tuna Road in Valhalla Park. Serial killer Cameron Wilson was found guilty of her murder and four others, for which he was sentenced to four life terms and 70 years. Charl says he has now given his last money towards a deposit for a tombstone which costs R15 000. He says Lekita's is not the only grave being damaged by vandals. “Do you know the hurt one feels when you see the damage these scoundrels do? I mean, they do this for drugs or whatever else. They have no respect for the dead,” he adds. “I really want to have her grave look decent. I have placed my last on a deposit of R2 000 for a tombstone for her. My daughter does not deserve this. She never deserved any of this.” If you would like to assist Charl to erect a tombstone for Lekita, you can contact him on 062 267 1944. Daily Voice

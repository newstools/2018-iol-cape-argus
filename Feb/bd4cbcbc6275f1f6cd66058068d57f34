“In light of the drought that Cape Town is facing, the entire festival will be water wise and operate outside the municipal grid. This includes ablution facilities which will be brought in, instead of using the existing infrastructure at the stadium,” Heart FM said. The sold-out 12-hour Heart Cape Town Music Festival takes place on Saturday at Newlands Cricket Grounds, and some of the country’s top artists will be performing. They include Emo Adams, Jimmy Nevis, Paxton Fielies, Alistair Izobell, Dr Victor & The Rasta Rebels, Mango Groove, Prime Circle, AKA and Cassper Nyovest. “Throughout the day patrons will be reminded that they need to be conscious of water usage. Heart FM is not only committed to leading by example as to being water conscious, but the festival is also running off bio-friendly generators to reduce harm to the environment,” Heart FM said. Meanwhile, the Shoprite Group said it has heeded the call of South Africans to help Cape Town and other drought-stricken communities through its till-point donation facility. Customers will be able to help by donating money to the Group’s Disaster Relief Fund by adding increments of R5 to their purchases at till points at any Shoprite or Checkers store. “An effective way to help is to donate money, as water is difficult to pack and transport. The money raised will be utilised to source water optimally and transport it in the most efficient way to provide help to those suffering in the crisis. "The Disaster Relief Fund was established in March 2016,” the retailer said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

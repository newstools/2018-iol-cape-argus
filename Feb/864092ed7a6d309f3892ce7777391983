He spoke to the media on Tuesday on a turnaround vision for the police, with a focus on the Western Cape. Sitole said while deployment of the army had been promised, it would be  only assist the police in specific operations, such as Operation Fiela. “We launched Operation Fiela, and in our understanding, the defence force will be a part of the operation, but the deployment will be done subject to the operational agreement that we have with the defence force. “So while I am saying the defence force will join us, I don’t want to create the impression that soldiers will patrol alone in the streets and deal with crime. They will be a part of Operation Fiela.” The operation was launched earlier this year and police have netted a number of criminals since then. Last year, the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution said they believed the call for the deployment of the army was a “kneejerk reaction” in responding to crime and was misguided. The organisation said the country needed a more holistic approach. Sitole added that they would work on boosting police morale. “I am going
to ground and mixing with the officers.
I go to share experiences, and just meeting them and shaking their hands boosts their morale.” Earlier this week, provincial spokesperson FC van Wyk said police had conducted an operation in Harare and were assisted by officers from as far as Worcester. “At one address in 19 block Mandela Park, Khayelitsha, at about 5.30pm, a police search led to the recovery of a Browning pistol, loaded with four live rounds. A 38-year-old man was arrested for the possession of the illegal firearm and ammunition.” He said they also arrested a 33-year-old man, a 50-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy for a range of crimes. The suspects are due to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court on Friday.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

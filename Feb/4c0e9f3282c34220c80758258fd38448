Among those present was Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Dr Lobsang Sangay, president of the Central Tibetan Administration, Ian MacFarlane of the SA Friends of Tibet and Ngodup Dorjee,a representative of the Dalai Lama. “South Africa represents what freedom means and what it should be Many people in this country went to prison and died. They fought for this freedom. And with the assistance of the international community freedom was restored,” Sangay said. Tibet was in the same situation as South Africa was, and he hoped his message would travel across the international community, he added. “This symbolises the issue of human rights, which is an issue for not just one country, but of all of us. Therefore, the support we give to Tibet is vital,” Buthelezi said. Tibet has been on shaky ground with China, after the Tibetan government was declared illegal in March 1959. The communist regime in China invaded Tibet at the time. The People’s Republic of China claims that Tibet is a significant part of China. But the government in Tibet, who remains in exile, maintains that Tibet is an independent state, which is under unlawful occupation.

NSRI Simon’s Town has alerted the public that a life-saving buoy erected on Glencairn beach was stolen. The buoy, which was donated to the NSRI,  lasted less then three days before it was targeted by robbers. It was put on the beach on Friday as a safety initiative by the NSRI and is valued at R2 000. It was reported missing on Sunday morning after institute staff noticed that it was gone. “The buoy was sponsored as part of our drowning programme,” said NSRI Simon’s Town station commander, Darren Zimmerman. “It’s placed at beaches that have have rip currents and Glencairn was identified as one of these beaches. In the early hours of the morning it was stolen.” A board stating, “Once you’ve saved a life, please return this rescue buoy so that we can save another”, was left on the beach. On the NSRI’s Facebook page, the rescue service appealed to the community to help retrieve the item. “Pink buoys are unique to the NSRI. If you see a pink buoy, it is from this initiative. Please share to help us find the rescue buoy,” the post read. “People need to be educated on the importance of it. It’s like stealing a fire extinguisher, you’re putting others at risk,”  Zimmerman said. The buoy, a floating device which has a rope attached to it, is used on beaches to save lives as it can be thrown out to anyone in danger of drowning. According to Zimmerman, several of the pink buoys have already been used around the country by the public. Zimmerman has requested the public to look out for the pink buoy, and report its whereabouts to the institute.

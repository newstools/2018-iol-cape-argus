The advert, which offers accommodation for rent, specifically states that it is targeted at whites-only tenants. “NB for white students only. Apartment for renting now available! If you are interested please contact me on the following (number) for an appointment.” RELATED: Former sprinter denied rental based on colour of skin It goes on to say that the place is located next to Rhodes High School and the rent is R4 000 per month. At the bottom of the advert, it then states three rules, which includes prohibiting students from allowing friends at the apartment, especially black people. A picture of the advert circulated on Twitter to which Zille responded that she would be investigating. Later, Zille tweeted and said she has been unable to track the number. The Cape Argus conducted its own investigation. After calling the number on the advert various times and unable to get through we managed to track the number down to a home in Mowbray, which is located near Rhodes High School.        A man answered the door, but did not answer any of the Cape Argus questions and did not provide any details about the ad and whether he was implicated in it. The advert on Twitter sparked outrage. “This has been doing rounds, several people has called the number and the person has confirmed the AD was tampered with so it's fake. Call the number yourself if you wish to do so,” Sihle Tuta tweeted. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

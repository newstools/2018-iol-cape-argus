Cape Town - Anton Bredell, the minister of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning in the Western Cape, says the province continues to manage the ongoing water crisis with the goal of avoiding a situation where any municipality including the City of Cape Town runs out of water. “We remain optimistic going forward that we will see the province into its usual winter rainfall period with some water left in the system, provided that water consumption continues to be driven down," he said. "We require the continued support and water saving by the public and other stakeholders. In the metro region this means using less than 50 litres per person per day, if we are to avoid a day zero scenario where the city may have to turn taps off to further manage the system.” Bredell says while latest dam figures are alarming, there are some positive indicators. “The largest dam providing water to Cape Town, the Theewaterskloofdam is currently 11.7% full. This dam is however being managed purposefully downwards, with water being purposely pumped to other neighbouring Cape Town system dams. "These include the Steenbras Upper dam (81% full) and the Berg river dam (52% full). The reasoning is that this makes a huge saving on the evaporation of water – a significant contributor to water losses in the province.” Bredell has reiterated the need for continued water savings in the province. “The entire province barring a few places only, remains at risk and in the grips of the drought. Moving forward it requires a continued team effort to get through the situation. We want to urge the public to continue to reduce water usage.” * Theewaterskloof is currently at 11.7% (2017: 30.8%); Voëlvlei Dam is at 17.3% (2017: 37.9%) and Clanwilliam Dam 13.1% (2017: 42.7%). Brandvlei Dam is 12.5% (2017: 27.03%).  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

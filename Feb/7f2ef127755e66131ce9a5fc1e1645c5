MEC of Transport and Public Works Donald Grant condemned the shooting. “We suspect this was a targeted attack, with bystanders being caught in the crossfire. The Provincial Transport Registrar has already instituted a Section 7(A) 20 (of the Western Cape Road Transportation Act, Amendment Law, Act 8 of 1996) inquiry against members of Cata, who operate on the Langa routes, who are believed to be part of the ongoing dispute. “This inquiry will determine whether the association involved should be suspended or de-registered if the circumstances support this,” he said. Grant said he planned to publish a Section 91 (of the NLTA) notice, declaring his intention to close down routes or ranks as a result of persistent violent conflict. When the Cape Argus visited the taxi rank the atmosphere was still tense. Police vans and two Nyalas had been deployed to the taxi rank. A woman, who refused to be named, said she was standing opposite the rank, waiting for her grandchildren who travel by taxi. “I would rather wait here because I am afraid the taxi they are travelling on could be hit too. It’s really not safe here and we just want this war of theirs to end,” she said.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

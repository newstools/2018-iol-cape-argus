She gasps to catch her breath after completing a swim from Robben Island to Bloubergstrand. McGouw was on Wednesday joined by Roger Finch, 60, and Tracy Clarke, 48, who helped her out of the water to join the other swimmers who completed the route in under three hours. Some took on the challenge in preparation for the Varne Ridge English Channel, which will be coming up later this year, while others simply did it to challenge themselves. The swimmers are part of the Varne Ridge English Channel and Robben Island swim club lead by Finch.   “Ellery McGouws is 72, it’s amazing isn’t it. It took about two to three hours to complete the swim. Only 2% of swimmers who do the channel are under the age of 35. They don’t have the mental capacity to face the task. “This is our very first Cape Town to Robben Island camp. Cape Town is the most successful place to train for the channel. It is one of the top 10 toughest swims in the Southern Hemisphere,” said Finch. McGouw said it was her first time doing the swim from Robben Island to Big Bay and she was still considering whether she wanted to take part in the English Channel swim. Another swimmer, Deborah Vine, 62, said while swimming three humpback whales joined the team, which she initially thought was terrifying. Before their body temperatures could adapt to the warmer climate outside, McGouw, Finch and the others picked a pebble on shore to hide in their swimming costumes, which is an old tradition, and went back into the chilly waters to board the boat which took them back to Granger Bay. Finch said the swimmers will embark on many more open water swims over the next five days to ensure that those who partake in the English Channel swim are well prepared. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Engelbrecht, who matriculated from Claremont High School last year, went up against 550 participants. He recently started studying engineering and mechatronics at Stellenbosch University. Engelbrecht said he was among many pupils at his school who had benefited from EMSS classes, held at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology every Saturday morning. “Our ultimate reward is to help set them up to pursue stimulating careers in maths and science-related fields that won’t only benefit them personally, but also the economy as a whole,” said Adhila Hamdulay, Engen’s corporate social investment 
manager. Engelbrecht scored 92% for science and 95% for maths in 2017. His Grade 12 results helped secure him a four-year bursary to cover his tuition and residence fees at Maties. He achieved seven distinctions in the nine subjects he wrote during his matric exams. “I learnt something new every week, which really helped me up my final results. I was already performing well at school, but I wanted to do better, and that’s the boost I got from the extra learning,” he said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

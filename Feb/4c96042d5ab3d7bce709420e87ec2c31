Cape Town - Western Cape police have released the identikits of two suspects sought in relation to attacks on Noordhoek beach in Cape Town. The latest attack took place on Saturday, February 17, when a couple was attacked. The suspects fled with a cellphone and other personal effects. A woman was hit over the head with a bottle in an attack the victims said "took about 20 seconds". "This guy came up to us and I said 'morning sir’ and he asked where we were going. He started attacking us and I used my bag to protect me. By some miracle, after the fourth or fifth stab, the blade broke off," Dewald le Grange, the husband of the woman who was attacked, said. "He ran and picked up a bottle and hit my wife with it and then threw it at me. I asked him what he wanted and he said ‘phones, phones’ I gave him my cell phone and he ran away. People ask me what he looks like, what was he wearing. When someone tries to stab you, you don’t look at that," said Le Grange.

“Wholesome Bread feeds the Western Cape, and we are close to and very (much) in touch with our market. Building strong communities and responding to the needs and wants of our market is core in building brand loyalty,” said Wholesome Bread spokesperson Ryan van Wyk. Van Wyk said that the company had a responsibility to provide its growing customer base with a quality product at a competitive price, and with unparalleled service. “Giving back, investing in our communities, and building strong brand awareness are all core principles we aspire to and which permeate throughout our organisation.” It was four years ago when the partnership between the organisers of the Cape Town Big Walk and Wholesome Bread began. “We admire and respect the Big Walk and its core social responsibility component. We have been searching for some time to find the right partner in communicating our vision and building our brand. By joining forces and partnering with the Argus and the Big Walk, we believe our vision and goals are aligned and there is a complimentary strategic fit. “This is another big step in the long road to entrench our brand, to build brand loyalty and to give back to our communities who have supported us over so many years,” Van Wyk said. The event is expected to attract more than 20 000 walkers this year. The Cape Argus has come on board as an official media sponsor for the event. The walk will start at Vlei Road opposite Cape Town Stadium, and end at the Green Point Track on March 18. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

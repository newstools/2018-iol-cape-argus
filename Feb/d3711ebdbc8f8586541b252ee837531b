“The producers were looking for a director for the movie the project was already in the pipeline. I was very reluctant to do it but the producers were very persistent,” Joshua said. Pakkies, who killed her drug addict son Abie in 2007, suffered an abusive life at his hands. She strangled him to death. Pakkies was sentenced to three years of community service. During this time she became a community leader who dedicated her life to the fight against drug abuse. Joshua said he met Pakkies before commencing the project. “I met Ellen in Muizenberg and I spent two hours speaking to her about her life and what she went through. “While speaking to her I just thought to myself that this is a genuine mother. She came across extremely warm.” Joshua said. Pakkies is played by TV drama Suidooster actress Jill Levenberg. Joshua said that he wanted someone who understood what it was like to live on the Cape Flats to play the role of Pakkies. “You want to know that the actor is acting in a authentic way that someone can relate too and someone who understands the Cape Flats,” he said. The movie has already been screened at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in the Netherlands. “I am humbled that by international standards, a small film has managed to be recognised by such a prestigious festival. We are truly humbled and just want to say thank you to everybody who made it possible, especially Ellen Pakkies,” executive producer Paulo Areal said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Kim Kardashian West has earned £23,000 (about R377 840) on the multiple shares her husband Kanye West bought her for Christmas within just two months. The 40-year-old rapper - who has four-year-old daughter North, two-year-old son Saint and four-week-old Chicago with the 37-year-old reality star - spent over $200,000 on stocks also in Netflix, Amazon and Adidas in December. According to TMZ, Amazon and Adidas have boomed on the stock market earning £17,000 and £12,000, and are proving to be a worthwhile choice, whilst Netflix and Disney are yet to deliver. Disney has dropped £1,500, and Apple too has slumped. The multiple shares purchased for £286,000 are estimated to be valued at £309,012. The 'Keeping Up with the Kardashian' star received 920 shares in Disney amounting to $100,000, whilst she has 995 in Adidas purchased for $168. The other amounts were kept concealed by Kim, who captioned the post on Instagram: "Best husband alert!"  Before unveiling the generous purchases from the 'All Day' hitmaker, Kim showed off more modest stocking fillers in the form of products from each of the companies, which Kanye used as cryptic clues to what she would find next. Kanye put gift cards for Netflix ($60) and Amazon ($100), socks by sports brand Adidas, a pair of Air Pods by tech giants Apple and a Mickey Mouse cuddly toy. In the clip going over the gifts posted on her Instagram Story on Tuesday, Kim says: "Okay, so for one of my Christmas presents from Kanye he gives me this little box with a Disney Mickey toy, Apple headphones, Netflix, Amazon gift cards and Adidas socks." Before adding: "But then I open the next box and it is stock to Amazon, where he got the gift card, stock to Netflix, stock to Apple where he got the headphones, Adidas stock and Disney stock."

Abdurahman, who has lived in the area for three decades, said the area had been in this condition for years and nothing had changed. “Traffic officials overlook the encroachment of driving surfaces by fruit vendors as they overflow off the sidewalk from their illegal sites Fish vendors have no clean water, no waste bins, no toilets, some causing a serious stench in adjoining residential areas. “Solid waste collects late evenings while shoppers must face the filth and stench. All the above is a health danger to the community and is a direct insult to the many shoppers and residents of the Cape Flats. Surely the powers that be should assign law enforcement to uphold law and order?” asked Abdurahman. Ward councillor Aslam Cassiem said he had been dealing with issues relating to the  trading area since his second week in office. Cassiem said concerns were raised in sub council meetings in November, but assistance offered by the City to vendors was declined. “A waste management plan to put out bins in the area was refused by some who said the bins would get stolen. Only three out of 10 produce owners took up the offer to have bins. The rest didn’t want to take responsibility for the bins. “Solid waste cleans the area from 5am to 1.30pm. Social services go out into the area and they have a relationship with vagrants in the area who know them by name. We have operations where we clear out the area, but they’re back the next day,” said Cassiem. Cassiem explained that there were a variety of reasons behind the problems at the trading area, but that a steering committee to find a solution was on the cards.  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

*  Lamps should be marked with at least the following: mark of origin or manufacturer’s name, related voltage, related wattage and frequency. *  The “CE” mark appears on many products, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the “Conformité Européen” certification mark indicating conformity with EU health, safety, and environmental protection standards. It could also mean “China Export”. *  Don’t buy the cheapest product on the market. *  Be cautious about performance claims, such as those often found on LED light bulbs. *  Look for signs of inferior quality or workmanship. *  When in doubt, contact SAFEhouse for assistance or visit www.safehousesa.co.za.

The Central line has been out of commission due to the murder of a security guard in Khayelitsha, ongoing vandalism in Nyanga and Bonteheuwel, and a test train derailing and proving the line was not safe for use. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott cannot comment on when the line would be operational. “We understand the frustration as this has affected thousands of commuters," she said. "As we start a new month, we are encouraging those who can afford the Golden Arrow bus to buy the ticket and those who can’t to go to any station and buy the monthly ticket." Over the weekend, police arrested a 33-year-old Prasa (Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa) technician in Khayelitsha after he was found with stolen rail infrastructure. Last week, five suspected cable thieves were apprehended in Bishop Lavis and Bonteheuwel. Scott said such thefts were "a very worrying" and ongoing trend.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Price said they held a Spay Day on Saturday which saw 46 furry-legged friends spayed at the weekend. “Since the end of 2013 we have spayed over 3000 animals in the Valhalla Park area. Every six months we see a massive spike in animal breeding and the community cannot afford it,” Price said. The Valhalla Park Animal Welfare was established after a massive fire broke out  in December 2013, leaving over 300 people displaced and a number of animals dead or seriously injured. Since then, they have provided basic medical services to animals and assistance such as feeding, treatments and dipping to avoid tick and flea infestation. Price said that spaying animals was vital. “You can see massive health improvements when animals go for spaying; it prevents animals from getting cancer and it helps residents save money,” Price said. Among the health benefits include saving female canines from severe uterine infections,  which can develop into a life- threatening surgical emergency. Price said she and her team have growing concerns about the animal population in Valhalla Park, where the estimated animal population is up to 15 000. The 24th annual World Spay Day is on Tuesday, February 27. The day draws attention to  affordable and accessible spaying of animals, especially those who live in shelters and which are at risk on the streets. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

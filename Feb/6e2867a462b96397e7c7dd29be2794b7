The Red Cross Children’s Hospital Trust is one of four beneficiaries. Trust head of fund-raising, Chantel Cooper, has described its relationship with the CTBW as an epic love story. “Our relationship with the Big Walk is more than just about the money. Our relationship has come along for the past 20 years and grown,” she said yesterday. The relationship stemmed from the CTBW organisers and the trust sharing the same values, she added. “They share our same values, where we care for one another and where family is important, so we decided to join hands with them." The trust, an independent organisation, was established in 1994 to raise funds for specific projects and programmes to assist in advancing child health care at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital. The trust is responsible for raising funds for the upgrade and expansion of the hospital buildings, and is investing in state-of-the art medical equipment at the hospital - the only one in Africa to offer a comprehensive range of specialist paediatric services to children. Funds have also been used for training medical professionals across Africa, Cooper said, adding that the trust was heavily dependent on donations. “We are currently raising funds for the oncology unit,” Cooper said. The CTBW is one of Cape Town’s main outdoor family sporting events, and is expected to attract 20000 people keen to do their bit for charity while having fun. Other beneficiaries of the walk are the Academia Library and Resource Centre in Lansdowne, the Manenberg People’s Centre and a Philippi-based NGO. “We are overwhelmed by the support and gratitude the Big Walk has shown us all these years,” Cooper said. This year the Cape Argus is the official media partner for the event along Wholesome Bread, and the producers of Jive cooldrink. The walk is on Sunday, March 18. @MarvinChalres17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

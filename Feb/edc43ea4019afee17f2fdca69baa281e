Rust, 77, was found dead on the kitchen floor by her husband Manie Rust, 87, in their home in Third Avenue, Uitsig, in May 2016. Nigel, who was a few months shy from turning 19 at the time of the murder, and his uncle Johannes Plaatjies, 35, were convicted. State prosecutor Monwabisi Mabiya asked that the court hand a harsh sentence of life imprisonment to both. “When one looks at accused one’s (referring to Nigel) situation he is not different from most youth from Khayelitsha, Nyanga etc. “You find a young person who is very talented. They just want someone to help realise their dream. “Accused one found that in the deceased. He took advantage of the opportunity he was given,” he said. Earlier, the court heard submissions from the defence. Advocate Yasemeen Rajab said: “He (Nigel) acted irrationally; the decision to commit the crime was not thought out. He kept lying afterwards. It was those lies that hit the nails in the coffin.” Sentencing will take place on March 14.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Early on Tuesday morning, Prasa officials joined commuters on a train from Langa to the Cape Town station as part of a site inspection. The line was reopened last Wednesday after being shut down for five weeks due to crime and vandalism. Through his engagement with the commuters, Molepo acknowledged Prasa was under siege by criminals. “I am happy I got this chance to interact with people; it was heartbreaking to hear how deeply they were affected, with some losing jobs. They have agreed to work with us and law enforcement to ensure the protection of the infrastructure. "Through this partnership we will be able to prevent what happened from happening again,” Molepo said. “As part of an extreme clampdown, 60 extra private security personnel, which the City will also assist with, will be brought in. Officers armed with shotguns were tasked with monitoring specific hotspots along railway lines. Drone technology will also be used to improve security along the Central train line. "We are finalising a memorandum of understanding with the police,” Molepo said. Bridgette Summers, 55, from Belhar, who has been using the train for 30 years, said crime had spiked over the years. “When we get to certain stations we have to pray hard we don’t get robbed Securities sit in the first class and have conversations We want to go to work and back home safely.” Summers said three people she worked with had been fired as they battled to get to work with the Central line closed. Karol Knoop, also from Belhar, was among commuters calling for more security. He was robbed on his way home.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

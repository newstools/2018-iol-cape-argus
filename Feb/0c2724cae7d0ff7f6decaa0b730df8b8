Department of Sport and Cultural Affairs MEC Anroux Marais said the audit aims to identify all offensive names, “as part of the ongoing process to develop a common national identity, social cohesion and inclusivity within the province”. “Proposed name changes of the identified names will be processed in accordance with the Western Cape policy for the Naming and Renaming of Geographical Features of 2015 and the South African Geographical Names Council Act of 1998.” ANC leader in the legislature Khaya Magaxa said they did not have a problem with the changing of old names and supported the idea of names that reflected “our heritage”. Magaxa said there were many eople, like Oscar Mpeta, Chris Hani and Christmas Tinto who were not properly recognised for their part in the Struggle. “While we welcome the naming of Nelson Mandela Boulevard we feel it’s frustrating to go around and not see names of people who played important roles, in prominent places like main streets.” The Freedom Front Plus has said the call to should not be a priority during the drought. The audit, which aims to identify all offensive geographical names of streets, squares, parks and suburbs for review, is said to assist with social cohesion and inclusivity within the province.

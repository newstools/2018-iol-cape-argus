The fishers said they had received permits that allowed them to get rock lobster, but said it was pointless without licenses for their boats, as they could not go out to sea. One of the fisher's, Christiaan McKenzie, said they were told that their permits had not yet been processed after they applied for them last year. “The season is coming to an end on February 28, leaving us a few weeks if they send them out in time.” McKenzie said they were not able to provide for their families and said he resorted to borrow money to put food on their table. “Our people are going hungry. They need to make this right, so we can be able to provide for our families.” Jennifer Carolus said all she knew was the sea and because of the bungle they were not able to enjoy their Christmas last year. “It was a very dark Christmas for us. This whole thing has just made us suffer so much.” Carolus cares for her disabled husband, two daughters and eight grandchildren “I am a fisher's child, a fisher's wife and I grew up on crayfish and fish. I know nothing else.” Morgan Johnson said they were given permits, but that was pointless to them and they were promised over and over that the boat licenses would come. “We cannot go on the water without the license because we will get locked up. But maybe that is what we must do in order to get them to listen to us.” He said they had spent R8 000 to get to Cape Town and they were demanding to get reimbursed by the department. “We do not have money to get here and we want them to pay our money back. We are poor people.” The department had not responded to the Cape Argus by the time of going to print.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

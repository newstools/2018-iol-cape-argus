Christo Hartmaan entered into a plea and sentence agreement with the State, admitting to the murder of his son, Christiano Filander. On Thursday, Western Cape High Court Judge Robert Henney said this was the strangest case he had come across. “The accused does not present himself before this court as a monster, or person who is devoid of feelings and empathy. "One cannot even imagine or begin to think what this child must have endured at the time the accused assaulted him,” said Judge Henney. Christiano was murdered on February4 last year at a farm in Retreat. On the day of the murder, Hartmaan had gone to fetch his son from his mother’s home, also on the farm. He said that upon arrival, Christiano's mother told him that she was about to feed him. She prepared porridge and gave it to Hartmaan to feed the baby at home. Hartmaan said that during feeding, Christiano cried and soiled himself. “Because of my frustration, I assaulted the child by slapping him in the face and on the neck numerous times, and hitting him once against the head with my fist. When I hit him against the head with my fist, I held his head at the back with my other hand. “I also hit and slapped him on the chest/lower abdomen and scratched his lower back in the process,” Hartmaan stated. After realising that the infant was no longer breathing and was silent, Hartmaan wrapped him in a sheet, placed him on a crate in his room and called for help. The baby was declared dead at the scene. Judge Henney said Hartmaan's conduct was inexcusable, repulsive and inhumane. “No matter what amount of frustration, humiliation and provocation the accused might have endured on that specific day, it is only a coward who commit such a horrendous crime,” he said.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

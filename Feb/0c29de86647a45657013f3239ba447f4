The free event will transform streets in those neighbourhoods into car-free zones to create a space for people to engage in activities, creative showcases and discussions on how to reduce water consumption. The World Wildlife Fund will host a “Water Wise Hub” and the Cape Town Science Centre will host a “Hack the Water Crisis” event. ActionArte Foundation SA will put on a performance around the theme of water, and Miss Earth SA and Explore4Knowledge will co-host the “Water Cape Town” awareness campaign. Other activities to look forward to on the day include live graffiti, a reading corner for children, salsa dancing on the street, Zip-Zap Circus magic performance and an advice assembly hosted by Reclaim the City. Open Streets spokesperson, Marcela Guerrero Casas said drivers should be aware that Sir Lowry / Victoria Road (the M4) between Russell Street and Salt River Road will have no vehicle access and between Salt River Road and Groote Schuur Drive only the inbound lanes will be closed with the outbound lanes accommodating traffic in both directions. Guerrero Casas said that public transport operators have been consulted and routes have been amended for the day, but there will be full access to Groote Schuur Hospital. “For those who have time on their commutes, the invitation is to take part in Open Streets. It’s free and everyone is welcome. The street will become a playground for people of all ages,” said Guerrero Casas. Golden Arrow Bus Services, operations manager, Anwar Ally, said the company supports Open Streets and will keep commuters informed about routes changes on the day. MyCiTi route 102 will continue to run and marshals at the intersection of Roodebloem and Victoria roads will give special access to the buses. Activities will start at 9am and end at 2pm on Sunday.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

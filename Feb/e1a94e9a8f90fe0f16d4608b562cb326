Roads, mostly in the CBD, will be closed from 06:00 to midnight on Friday 16 February 2018 to accommodate the State of the Nation Address. The road closures will affect the normal flow of traffic in and around the city bowl, Newlands, and the M3 and N2 city-bound lanes. As such, road users are asked to plan their routes accordingly. Road users are also alerted to the closure of the M3 and N2 at 17:45 on Friday. The M5 will be the best option as an alternative route.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

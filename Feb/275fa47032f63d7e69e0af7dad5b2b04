Carnival’s chief executive Jay Douwes said they were taking the situation seriously and were focusing on ensuring they implement practical and responsible measures in relation to their project, event and water issues. “The Western Cape is in the midst of an unprecedented drought. This has had a profound effect on all events organised in the city of Cape Town. Our 2018 objective is to have zero-water impact on the municipal water grid. The entire festival will be water wise. Rainwater tanks installed at the Cape Town Carnival Workshop in Maitland is the primary source of water used,” Douwes said. He said this included the use of grey and desalinated water. “Only chemical toilets will be used. Water sold by vendors will be sourced from outside municipal water grids. Self-contained food trucks will bring in their own water for food preparation or dishes and dispose of grey water. No water ballasting of structures will take place, only concrete ballasts will be used. "Spectators will be encouraged to bring their own water if they do not wish to buy bottled water,” Douwes said. He added no water taps would be installed along the fan walk. Water for those who could not afford water would be supplied, and dispensed in paper cups. The estimated number of spectators this year is 30 000, and performers 1 690. Last year, the carnival attracted 44 900 people and 1 391 participants. The Cape Town Carnival is a six-month production that culminates in a one-day parade that
has grown significantly since it was launched in 2010. This year’s edition will take place on March 17 under the theme "Mother City, Mother Nature"
and will bring the plants of Cape Town to life, according to creative director for the carnival Brad Baard.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Asked about the City of Cape Town's plans, and for suggestions, Xanthea Limberg, mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services, said the plastic bottles could be donated to people who needed them. “Many residents in the city aren't able to afford bottled water or containers. Rather than throwing away your empty water bottles, consider donating them to fellow residents who may need containers for their water,” she said. “Alternatively, contact your local charity to see if they are in need of additional water containers.” The City has 23 recycling and waste drop-off facilities, listed on its website, where residents can drop off recyclables, as well as bulky garage and garden waste, at no cost. There are also numerous private recycling drop-off points. “Residents should shop smartly for their bottled water. Plastic bottles that are clear and not coloured are more easily recycled. Bottles with printing directly on the bottle, metal caps or lids, and paper labels are more difficult to recycle,” Limberg said. Cape Argus

Operations on the Central Line were suspended a month ago due to vandalism and violence in which a security guard was shot dead. Bronwen Dyke-Beyer, Golden Arrow spokesperson, said the agreement is no longer in place and commuters have to purchase bus tickets. “We have seen a major increase in passengers on Central Line routes. Golden Arrow is operating at capacity during peak and the influx of Metrorail passengers placed strain on our operations during peak hours. We have had requests to add more buses on certain routes but unfortunately we simply do not have any extra buses,” Dyke-Beyer said. Public Transport Voice spokesperson Dalton Ndongeni said they were concerned that it’s been four weeks and Metrorail still can’t say when services will be back. “Commuters are frustrated and they have a right to be, as it’s been more than a month and still no feedback regarding maintenance on infrastructure. We are only receiving SMSes urging commuters to have alternative transport. People are in debt as they go to loan sharks for transport money, and these are poor people,” Ndongeni said. He said commuters felt neglected and Metrorail was not prioritising the Central Line, that’s why they are calling for a commission of inquiry. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “Metrorail confirms that while the central service is suspended, stations are closed on the Bishop Lavis; Chris Hani and Kapteinsklip routes. No tickets will be sold whatsoever and commuters are requested to utilise their cash to find alternative modes of transport.” Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said their priority is getting the Central Line back up and running. “Efforts have been beefed-up to clamp down on criminals paralysing the rail service. A number of cable thieves have been apprehended since the start of the year. We’re in the final stages of procuring additional security resources but we need to have visible policing at the stations,” Walker said.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

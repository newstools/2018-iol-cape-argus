Crawley hopes to raise funds in order to furnish a newly developed music school built by Bridges for Music in Langa. The organisation built the school to assist young people in impoverished areas to reach their dreams by pursuing a career after school. “A good friend of mine is involved in the organisation, and when we got chatting, I told her my goal to get fit this new year. She said someone had dropped out of their Cycle Tour group and asked if I would be interested. “It will be my first time participating. It's a jump in the deep end, but it’s amazing to be part of something that creates change where it's needed. We have been training for the tour by doing a circuit four times a week, cycling from Mouille Point to Hout Bay and back,” said Crawley. The modern school is being completed and the organisation hopes to open its doors in July, but funds are needed to purchase computers, music equipment and furnishings to turn the empty building into a learning centre. Bridges for Music founder Valentino Barrioseta said the organisation wants to use music to bridge social gaps in South Africa and to bring people together. They also want to adopt a modern education method, which will take a different approach to educating pupils. "We want to focus 50% on music and art and 30% on entrepreneurial skills and life skills. We have extramural activities for those aged 16 to 18 and we have modules for those aged 18 and older. “Cycling is a healthy exercise and a good way to raise funds we need for computers, gear and interior setting for our school,” said Barrioseta.

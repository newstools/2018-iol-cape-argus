Cape Town – Damage has forced commuters to use alternative transport after vandals struck overnight at Woodstock. This affected overhead and signal power between Woodstock and Cape Town. The train service said all trains arriving at and departing from Cape Town Station on Monday morning are being authorised, which results in delays of up to an hour. "Trains will be placed in a holding pattern on the approach to Cape Town Station. Repairs are in progress - at this early stage technicians are unable to estimate when repairs will be completed," said Metrorail in a statement. On the Northern Line, trains on the Muldersvlei/Strand line are delayed and on the Central Line, services are suspended. Stations are closed on the Lavistown/Chris Hani/Kapteinsklip routes and no tickets will be sold. "The public is encouraged to report any crimes/suspicious activity.

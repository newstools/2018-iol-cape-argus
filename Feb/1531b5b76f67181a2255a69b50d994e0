Members received a complaint of a stench coming from a residence in Wiener Street to which the Crime Prevention Unit responded. At approximately 13:00 they entered the premises where they uncovered an illegal abalone processing facility. Stainless steel pots, plastic containers and burners were found in a cooking room. A second room was a  fully equipped drying room filled with numerous shelves of abalone, of which many were undersize. These equipment and other, including scales, gas cylinders, boxes and also bags of salt were also seized. Three males age 37, 40  and 43 were arrested and are to appear in the Goodwood Magistrates Court on Thursday on charges under the Living Marine Resources Act. The exact value of the abalone confiscated is yet to be determined, however, it is valued at a substantial amount. The Western Cape Provincial Commissioner Lt Gen KE Jula says that protecting the marine resources will remain at the core of the SAPS’s mandate, and he also commended the members for a task well done.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

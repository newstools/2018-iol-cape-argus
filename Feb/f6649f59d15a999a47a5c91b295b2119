City council officials have been slammed for failing to plan properly. Xanthea Limberg, mayoral committee member for water, waste and informal settlements, said the city council moved from a third party electronic platform to an in-house electronic interface system for the uploading of monthly water meter readings on January 1. “Since this move, there have been technical challenges with uploading meter readings to the new system. As a result, some customers will receive estimated bills although their meter was read. Customers across the city will be affected, she said. “If the estimate is higher than the actual usage then their account will be adjusted appropriately the next time the actual meter reading is captured. "In cases where estimated consumption far exceeds actual consumption, and residents are unable to afford the bill, they can approach the city council’s call centre or their closest walk-in centre to request an investigation. "Debt management will be suspended until the investigation is resolved." Limberg said estimated bills are based on consumption for the same period in the previous year. Residents who have had their consumption estimated will rather be given a grey dot reflecting that no data exists for consumption on the property, she added. ACDP councillor Grant Haskin said the city council should have delayed the process. “They have clearly no foresight and lack of planning in the department," he said. "This technical difficulty will now cause serious problems for our residents." @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

They accused police of taking too long when responding to incidents. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said cases of malicious damage to the property and theft were opened. “At about 14:40, Muizenberg police responded to a shooting incident in Langeberg Road, Hillview, Muizenberg. Upon their arrival they discovered a body of a 31-year-old man with multiple gunshot wounds and he was declared dead on the scene. After the murder, residents of Hillview took part in a violent protest action, during which tyres were burnt and two SAPS vehicles were stoned and damaged.” Ward councillor Gerry Gordon said: “Over the past two months the shootings have intensified. The sad part is that innocent people are affected. I understand people’s frustration. The gangs are fighting over turfs again, we need police visibility at all times.”  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The challenge contains three routes and ranges from 20km to 60km. “A famous quote goes, ‘Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt’. Well, this year’s MTB Challenge has a dirt trail for every mountain biker,” marketing, media and sponsorship director the Cape Town Cycle Tour Trust, David Bellairs said. “The 20km route is perfect for those looking to ride with family and friends of varying ability; the 40km heads up to Delvera where the climbs can be pretty intense, so this route is geared towards more experienced riders; and the 60km route is a proper test with extended single-track runs and big climbs,” he said. Last year the 60km race was won by American Howard Grotts, who won the title ahead of Christoph Sauser and Matthys Beukes. The 2018 edition is expected to feature international enthusiasts. “Unfortunately we need to keep the fields pretty limited for each distance. Keen mountain bikers should enter soon so they don’t miss out,” Bellairs said. Excitement for the 2018 Cycle Tour is growing as eager participants and cycle enthusiasts prepare for the biggest cycling event in the world. The Cycle Tour Life Cycle Week kicks off on Saturday, March 3.

“It has affected us very badly because we depend on water to survive,” Safa Cape Town president Bennett Bailey said. He said that Safa could not cancel matches or furtherreduce its water consumption: “We have made sacrifices and to be honest with you, it doesn't look like the City (of Cape Town) has a plan in place.” Safa has been in frequent meetings with the City, he added, but no consensus had been reached. Earlier this month, Safa said it has lost about 47 000 members because of the drought. The association was making use of sports fields with artificial grass. “All we want is for the City to come to us and tell us, 'listen, you as the sporting organisation needs to do this and go there'. But instead they have not told us anything.” The Western Cape Cricket Association said it has made sacrifices, but fear that the drought could have a massive impact on its membership. “We're very concerned about our membership and I imagine that we will be losing a lot of members,” chief executive officer of the association, Nabiel Dien, said. The standing committee chairperson on Cultural Affairs and Sports, Lennit Max, has called on MEC Anroux Marais to engage with sports facilities to reduce its water consumption. “I do, however, call upon the (MEC) to continue these efforts in reducing water consumption and also to engage with privately-owned sport facilities to reduce their water usage," Max said. "Moreover, I call upon residents to ensure that we #DefeatDayZero.” @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

“I know we running out of water and it makes me scared because water is life and we can’t live without it,” said Anam Msusa, 9. He said Day Zero was when the taps would switch off: “I get tired when people tell me I must save water every time because I know I must.” Across the 108-year-old school, teachers have beefed up its water saving awareness campaigns. They’ve even encouraged students to not be “a Zero but a Hero”. “We started putting the empty buckets outside so we can catch the rain and have water for washing, flushing the toilets and for the dishes,” said Inganathe Magwagwa, 10. The thought of Day Zero frightened her: “It makes me scared because we can’t live without water and when Day Zero comes we are going to have no water for us,” she said. On Wednesday the #SaveWater ambassadors were in the Cape Town CBD during their roadshow at schools across the province. It kicked off at Hazeldene Primary School in Mitchells Plain on Monday. The pupils at Prestwich were given educational worksheets and a talk by international climate activist Catherine  Constantinides. Miss Earth ambassadors are also engaging in in-class room activities inspiring #WaterHeroes. Some of the other schools to be visited this week are Gugulethu, Langa, Athlone, Philippi, Constantia and Melkbos. The initiative is supported by the Cape Argus in conjunction with its #EveryDropCounts campaign aimed at saving water and changing the water use culture. It has a special full news page dedicated to water-related news. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Organisers say entries are already streaming in. “We are anticipating a crowd of around 17 000 to 18 000 at this year's event,” office manager Saaide Waggie said. This year, the Cape Argus has come on board as an official sponsor for the event. The walk promises to be a morning filled with fun, fitness 
and entertainment, fit for the whole family. The walk will start at Vlei Road opposite Cape Town Stadium and end inside the Green Point Track. “We established this event to raise funds for four beneficiaries among those beneficiaries we have chosen is the Red Cross War Memorial 
Children's Hospital because of 
the health impact they have on 
children,” Waggie said. Among the other beneficiaries include the Al-Ikhlaas Academia Library and Resource Centre, the Manenberg feeding scheme and the Oliver Tambo Village. Waggie said that they have implemented a number of measures to preserve water due to the ongoing drought in the province. “What we have done is that we have decided to stop giving out the water sachets and we have to distribute bottles to those participating instead,” Waggie added. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

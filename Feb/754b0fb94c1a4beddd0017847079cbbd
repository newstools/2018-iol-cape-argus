So who better than the Duchess of Cornwall to step in and help calm her nerves by inviting her to an intimate lunch at Clarence House? Meghan, who will marry Prince Harry on May 19, is said to have been feeling overwhelmed lately and sources say an instruction issued “from the very top" ordered all staff, aides and senior Royals to do everything they can to make her feel at ease as she adjusts to palace life. And by all accounts, the ever-jovial and down-to-earth Camilla, 70, was only too happy to oblige. “Camilla told Meghan to get herself to Clarence House so they could have a good long chat," I’m told. “The aim was for Meghan to be able to air any worries or grievances and for Camilla to help alleviate them. “Meghan may appear confident when on Royal walkabouts, but she does have some pre-wedding butterflies - not about Harry, but about her new life. “As Diana once famously said, there is no manual, so Camilla is the best thing Meghan has. Camilla is happy to help.’ My source says the meeting was warm and open, and the main worry that emerged was that Meghan, 36, feels too constrained by the court of Kensington Palace. “KP is beautiful, but when Meghan wakes up she has nowhere to go, really. She can’t potter about on the High Street, attend gym classes, or jog around Hyde Park. Instead she is confined to yoga at home or visits to Kate and William in apartment 1A. “Understandably, Kate is unable to give Meghan her undivided attention. Although she is happy to advise Meghan, she is busy with her two children and, of course, she is way into her third pregnancy.” Mail On Sunday.

The free classes are presented by Jamielah Liedeman, 48, who grew up in Mitchells Plain. She is also a former driving instructor and was Golden Arrow’s first female driving instructor in 2006. Liedeman, whose mother was also a teacher in Mitchells Plain, said it was her way of serving her community. “This is my way of giving back to the community. I want all these women to be able to drive one day. Apart from the driving, it is also about empowering the women to become independent.” She said she became involved in the programme when community worker Joanie Fredericks asked her to present the classes. After passing their learner licences, Jamielah will also teach them to drive. Fredericks said she was amazed and happy when she saw the women registering for the classes. She said the youngest student is 17 with the eldest being 64. Shamiela Abdullah, 62, from Tafelsig, said she always wanted to drive her own car “but I never had the chance”. “The first place I will be driving to when I get my licence is the Table Mountain cable car,” she said. Jasmina Abrahams, 57, from Mitchells Plain added: “When I have my 
driver’s licence I will be mobile and be 
able to collect stock for my sewing 
business.” Another resident, Delia Prins, said she bought a car a year ago but can’t drive it. “It would be nice to drive to the supermarket,” she said. Olivia Saunders (29) from Kensington, said learner licence classes are expensive. “I thanked God when I heard that this lady is doing it for free for the community. We are so thankful for it. Once I have my licence I will no longer have to wait for my boyfriend to drive,” she said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

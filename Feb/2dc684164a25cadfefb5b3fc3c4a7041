C*change has developed a project called c*hemRoots to provide teachers with the resources to explain key concepts in science to pupils. They have now launched a “lunch box”-size science kit to be distributed to 5000 teachers across the province. The kits are aligned with the school curriculum and it is hoped they will bolster the pass rates of chemistry pupils. The kits contain laminated paper, and dropper bottles for dispensing chemicals and substances like vinegar and baking soda, which can be easily replaced. “If chemistry is only theoretical, it is boring. If lessons are only done on the chalkboard, students don’t memorise them. There are multiple studies that prove this. "We want to provide them with easy experiments to visualise complex theories," said c*change representative and UCT associate professor, Nico Fischer. Fischer said: “In 2016 we came up with the idea, and last year we developed the kit. The curriculum prescribes some practicals, but they aren’t always done due to lack of equipment or teachers not being confident in the outcome." According to material developer for c*hemRoots, Dr René Toerien, the kit was being tested at schools in the metro south district in the Western Cape, and would be rolled out across the province once more funding was acquired. Toerien said the kit focused on acids and bases due to matrics performing poorly in this area in past exams. Fisher said practicals would hopefully increase interest in chemistry, as only 27% of matrics wrote the physical science examination in 2016, and only 8.2% of those obtained the minimum entrance requirement of 70% for science at UCT. "The schools' development unit at UCT has an active programme at schools in Khayelitsha, and we’ll let teachers test it there this year,” said Fischer. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Koyana indicated he would engage them in negotiations about the land he owns in NY 108. The land has been invaded by backyarders. Koyana said that not all landowners were as keen. “The mayor met with one of the land-owners and they have indicated the land is earmarked for the development of rental units. They have also made it clear they are proceeding with an application for a court interdict against the land invasion to be heard later this month. “The City cannot take further action on this matter due to the ongoing litigation, ” Koyana said. In a recent meeting with the backyarders’ leadership, De Lille said a  registration and verification process of backyarders would be undertaken to cross-check against the waiting list and to take the potential beneficiaries through the registration procedure. Koyana said De Lille made it clear she could not give the backyarders permission to settle on any of the tracts of land as this would be illegal. However, Ludwe Joka, a community leader, said backyarders would remain there until they were moved to houses. zodidi.dano@in.co.za Cape Argus

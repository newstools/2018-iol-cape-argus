Cape Town - She was at her wits' end last week after her therapy dog, a Jack Russell named Cashew, disappeared. Michelle Koopman was so desperate to find her dog, she put up a R5000 reward. Her story was widely shared online after the Cape Argus published her plea on Thursday last week, and on Tuesday evening, Koopman and Cashew were reunited. Cashew was found at Maitland Cemetery.

Cashew spotted her before she saw him, and he ran towards her. "I did not give up! I would like to thank each and every one of you who helped me look for Cashew," Koopman said. "Thank you for every person who mailed me to update me on any news. Thank you for the prayers and support." Koopman had been abused by her mother as a child. When she saw Cashew in 2015, he reminded her of her childhood pet who helped her cope with the abuse. As a result of her experience, Koopman said she now plans to volunteer Animal Anti-Cruelty League branch in Epping. "I also have a meeting scheduled with the Manager of that branch to discuss me going out there, teaching kids and adults how to care for their dog, letting them know what the emergency numbers are in all areas in case they need to report that a dog is ill or has been knocked down," Koopman said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

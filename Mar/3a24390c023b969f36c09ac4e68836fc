The toy library at the Crossroads Library forms part of 12 others situated around the Cape which contain a variety of play and educational materials for children at various levels of development. These include books and educational toys that will aid the development of  young children. De Lille said early development was a critical stage in a child’s life and research by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) indicated that eight out of 10 Grade 4 pupils still could not read at an appropriate level.

It’s important now more than ever for us to value our children’s education and to ensure that they have the tools from an early age to be able to take on a challenging world. “We believe that the establishment of these ECD resource libraries will assist in ensuring that we cultivate a culture of reading at an early stage. This is a critical stage of the developmental phase,” said De Lille. De Lille said the ECD libraries would introduce a philosophy where children understood the importance of reading from a young age and would act as resources for parents and professionals who are pursuing the development of children to use. “I want to urge all parents to take full advantage of these ECD libraries,” said De Lille. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

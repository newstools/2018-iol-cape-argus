Well, great, let's get definitive for a change! "We're like a family now. Ten years later, we're hanging out and having lunch, and kind of wondering when the draft is going to come in. Which one of us bites it and when?" Meanwhile, Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, has hailed the upcoming movie as a pioneering moment for the film studio. While remaining tight-lipped about the upcoming movie's plot, Feige said that the next 'Avengers' releases will take Marvel in a new direction. He told Entertainment Weekly magazine: "The notion of an ending, the notion of a finale, became very intriguing to us, in large part because you don't see it that often in this particular genre."

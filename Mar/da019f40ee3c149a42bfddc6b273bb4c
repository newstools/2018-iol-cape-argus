They demanded answers from Education MEC Debbie Schäfer. They were promised a school three years ago, pupils claimed and said they were being taught in prefabricated classrooms. “We’re trying to find answers to problems we’ve been experiencing. It’s been 11 years since the school has existed. The classrooms are too hot. In summer we struggle because it's boiling hot, and it’s hard to concentrate. "When we come to exams, how can we perform when conditions are like that? Teachers go without us being told,” said pupil Aphiwe Nomdonto. Another pupil, Thando Mafalala, said: “Our bathrooms are so dirty, I can’t
understand it.” Western Cape Education Department  spokesperson Paddy Attwell said all interested parties are aware of the plan for the new school, as the department met with the school governing body, school management team and representative council of pupils on January 22  to discuss the issue. “The Department of Public Works has appointed a contractor to build the new Philippi High School following a tender process. The contractor will move on to the site on March 28,” he said. “The new school will relieve this overcrowding considerably. The current teacher to pupil ratio exceeds the norm. The department does not have a budget to allocate additional teachers at this stage. "The school is due for completion in October 2019, subject to any disruptions of the building programme,” said Attwell. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The event, which was hosted by Gloria and Rolf Theiler, is for the Match Development Foundation which funds the training, travelling and other expenses of young tennis players in the Cape. The event was a cocktail dinner. A hundred guests were invited with an entry fee of R5000 per person. Some of the high-profile guests who attended were sports stars such as Ed Moses, an Olympic gold medallist swimmer and world champion; tennis Grand Slam winner Martina Hingis; Olympic gold medallist swimmer Ryk Neethling; and the Swiss Ambassador. Founder of the Match Development Foundation, Anthula Markovitz, said the event was sponsored. All proceeds would go towards the foundation. “In partnership with the Anthony Harris Tennis Academy we sponsor and assist children from previously disadvantaged homes and those who are talented but can’t afford tennis training and coaching. We enrol them in the academy which offers high performance coaching and we cover the expenses of their travelling to tournaments, the training fees, and buy them the equipment,” she said. “We feel Africa and Cape Town should have a tennis champion. We are all for getting talented children to further their skills in tennis and being professional players,” she said. Markovitz said that at the moment the foundation funded 10 children and had 25 children on the waiting list. Costs per child vary. Funding for junior players is about R500000 up to R1million. @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

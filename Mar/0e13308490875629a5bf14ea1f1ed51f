Ampath Laboratories in Pretoria has advised that every supplier/manufacturer should certify their biltong as a non-carrier, so what is its status? Has the Department of Health conducted any research on dried meats? Is there any official clearance requirement? Has biltong been considered as a carrier? Has it been tested? Being so popular, it deserves a thorough assessment by the Department of Health, with due certification. Ironically, I have just heard Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, over SAFM Radio, state that the ST6 strain has not been found in biltong! He also said the strain is destroyed by cooking food. For years, I have been aware of  bacteria existing in biltong - uncooked meat - why is it not vulnerable to ST6? * Edwin Wittert, Oostersee. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.

Zoe, who has been practising her dance routine with her dad Edwin “Goal D Lox” Avontuur in their garage, earned a national qualifier award that will see her packing for Johannesburg to compete in the national round of the competition. RELATED: Teen keen to dance with more stars “She competed with people older than her and people went crazy when she performed. If she makes it through (in Johannesburg) she’ll be going to Los Angeles to dance in front of Jennifer Lopez and Neyo,” said Avontuur. Nine acts will be chosen at the finals to represent South Africa in Pasadena, LA. The World of Dance is one of the biggest dance competitions with a $1 million grand prize. Avontuur said his daughter started dancing at the age of two to a Neyo track. His own career as a dancer in Chain Reaction also fuelled her passion. “She danced with Justin Bieber last year and that's when she started to take dancing seriously,” he said. “We need a dance studio because it’s going to be difficult for her to compete with those who have dance studios. But we’re going to raise funds for her to go to Joburg,” said Avontuur. Zoe will be competing on May 3. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Unaids executive director Michel Sidibe said: “Structural, behavioural and biological factors make women more vulnerable to HIV infection, so it is extremely important that they have the opportunity to protect themselves from HIV on their own terms.” The ring is replaced monthly and releases the RV treatment slowly to the patient. After the beginning of the trial, the rate of new HIV infections was 1.9 women for every 100 participants. The researchers said that if the ring had not been issued to the women, the rate of new infections would have been at 4.1 for every 100. “Adherence was shown to be high in both of the trials, although the measures of adherence were not able to determine whether the women used the ring all of the time, most of the time or just some of the time. "The DREAM study showed that more than 90% of the women in the study used the ring at least some of the time, based on residual drug levels, and the HOPE study showed that 89% of returned rings indicated that the ring was used at least some of the time within the previous month.” Sidibe said this was the first time that efficacy of more than 50% was observed in HIV prevention trials, involving women only. “Two previous phase III trials presented in 2016, which did include a placebo group, showed only modest protection (30%) against HIV infection for women.” Sidibe said the recent advancements in the fight against HIV were very important.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

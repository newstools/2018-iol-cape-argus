A heartbroken Michelle Koopman from Elsies River is desperately looking for her companion therapy dog, which went missing four days ago. “This is how much he means to me. I know it sounds crazy, but just to get him back I am willing to pay that amount of money,” Koopman said. She suspects that Cashew has been stolen and the only way she can get him back is through money. His disappearance has gained the attention of Elsies River residents. Koopman said that several residents have assisted in searching for her dog. Koopman, 33, received the dog in 2013. But Cashew is more than just a dog to her; he has helped get her through years of depression. Koopman said she was physically abused as a child and forced to live with her grandmother. “I went through a lot when I 
was young. This is why finding him is such a big deal to me. Cashew wasn’t my guard or safety blanket, he was my support.” Koopman claims drug addicts in the area stole Cashew and sold him. She is begging anyone with information to contact her. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

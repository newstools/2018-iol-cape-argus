HAT ground operations manager Jason de Smidt said: “Seventeen of the best HAT chainsaw operators from as far as George came together to clear a very important catchment area above the Berg River Dam. After being airlifted to their base camp, they worked  effectively to clear the targeted area. There is still much more work to do but this 'first' for HAT in the Western Cape has been a big success.” Over the past few years, HAT teams have cleared invasive plants in:   In the Western Cape, there are 14 HAT teams of 136 participants stationed at partners such as CapeNature, SA  National Parks and the Cape Winelands municipality. Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) programmes such as Working for Water, Working on Fire and High Altitude Teams contribute significantly to protecting the environment while creating work opportunities under the Expanded Public Works Programme. In 2011, the HAT project was handed to Working on Fire to implement on behalf of the DEA. Currently, HAT projects provide work opportunities to at least 450 participants from previously disadvantaged backgrounds, and 99% are youth. There's also a strong women's presence. Over the 2017/18 financial year, more than 8080hectares of alien invasive vegetation were cleared.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

On March 25, a longer stretch of Eisleben Road, between Spine Road and Highlands Drive, will become a space for people to walk, cycle, skate, explore, play, connect and learn. This follows the successful Open Streets Main Road which was held on February 25, as well as several other Open Streets days across Cape Town. “Our intention was never for Open Streets to be an event, but rather a movement of citizens reimagining their streets together. And that’s why we never refer to it as an event, or even a festival! We took inspiration from Ciclovia, a Colombian programme of weekly car-free days that makes the streets of major cities accessible to pedestrians and non-motorised transport users every Sunday and public holiday. It’s exciting to see that the concept is catching on in Cape Town,” managing director of Open Streets Cape Town Marcela Guerrero Casas said. Mitchells Plain hosted two Open Streets days on Merrydale Avenue in April 2016 and on Eisleben Road a year later. The Open Streets community has chosen Eisleben Road again for the third instalment. “Open Streets is a unique opportunity for our community to come together and realise its potential. From getting to know each other in a safe and welcoming space to having the platform to showcase our different talents, March 25 will be an opportunity to build our networks in Mitchells Plain and beyond,” Ricky Mabee, founder of Mitchells Plain Alive, said. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

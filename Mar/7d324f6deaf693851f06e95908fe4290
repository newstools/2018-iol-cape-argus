Donations of milk are received in Eden, George and Oudtshoorn hospitals to nourish babies whose mothers are unable to breast-feed or have enough milk for their baby. Western Cape Department of Health spokesperson Nadia Ferreira said milk donation was a practice that should continue throughout the year, because using only breast milk to feed premature babies reduced the risk of infection by more than 10%. “The importance of donor milk is emphasised by the large number of low birth weight or premature babies. Breast milk is even more important for premature babies, who are at high risk of developing inflammation of the bowel, known as necrotising enterocolitis. “Oudtshoorn Hospital had 24 babies with a birth weight of less than 1kg born in 2017. Another 29 had a birth weight of 1kg to 1.499kg, and 57 babies weighed between 1.499kg and 2kg at birth. Lactating mothers who can express enough extra milk are asked to contact either George Hospital or Oudtshoorn Hospital to sign up as a breast milk donor,” said Ferreira. Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo said she wanted to thank all the donor moms for donating their breast milk for the worthy cause and encouraged all mothers to breast-feed from birth and take into account the fact there were mothers who were unable to breast-feed. “Breast milk provides the right nutrition during the first 1 000-day window and can have a profound impact on a child’s ability to develop and learn."  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

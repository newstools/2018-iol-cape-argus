Provincial police leadership presented their Day Zero safety plan for all areas in the city. Deputy provincial commissioner Mpumelelo Manti said the police’s plan will be changed as needed and stressed that the police will be able to attend to any eventuality. “We have a plan and I would like to assure all residents that should Day Zero arrive we will be ready. We have operational units available to assist the officers deployed at the collection points. "We are also ensuring that normal visible policing will continue as we have made provision for this. Officers on duty for normal visible policing duty will be called in if there is a need for them,” Manti said. Day Zero, which is now set to be implemented on July 9, is when the taps in the city will be turned off to almost all communities. When dam levels reach 13.5%, the Day Zero plans kick in. Manti said volatile areas, especially on the Cape Flats, will be prioritised with extra police personnel. “We don’t want to pre-empt things, but we have made plans. We have a list of high-risk areas and we have plans to handle this. We also have the assistance of the SANDF and they will be called in, depending on the severity of the situation. "We also have metro police and other law-enforcement agencies that will assist when needed. Police and the SANDF will also be using helicopters to pick up and drop officers off in emergencies. Officers who can assist will be deployed in areas where they are needed,” he said. Brigadier Jorina Zandberg, provincial head of the Operational Command Centre, said officers stationed at collection points, police stations, training centres and other facilities will be able to receive their allocation of water. “There will be water made available to our officers at the collection points and wherever they find themselves. They will be relieved to ensure that there are no gaps." @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

The Academia Library and Resource Centre is a place which has fostered creativity and learning in the community for years. The library is located in Lansdowne and was established in September 1987. It has developed a long and involved relationship with the community, and has come to be respected as an institution that embraces universal values of tolerance, equality and democracy. With 25 years of library management experience, it is poised to enter a new era of academic scholarship and technological innovation. The library is one of four beneficiaries. “I feel that this library is one of a kind Here we have a library that has over 45 000 books and children can navigate through the knowledge of this facility,” chairperson of the board of trustees, Dr Elias Parker, said. The library is state-of-the-art and has a seminar room, interactive conference room, audio visual room and a research unit . “This entire library was paid for out of the pockets of individuals,” Parker said. Other beneficiaries of the Big Walk are the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Trust, the Manenberg People’s Centre and the Oliver Tambo Village, a Philippi-based NGO. This year, the Cape Argus is the official media partner for the event, alongside Wholesome Bread and the producers of Jive cooldrink.

A plaque was unveiled at the  administration building on Wednesday. “We as the university acknowledge that we have unfairly benefited from the injustice of the past. This indicated that major tension between the campus and the community of District Six was growing,” Deputy Vice-Chancellor Anthony Staak said. RELATED: District Six residents upset over CPUT's Cape campus renaming The event saw the celebration and memorialisation of the rich heritage of District Six and acknowledged the pain that was caused when the then-Cape Technikon was built on the site. “This was the legacy that the new Cape Peninsula University of Technology inherited in 2005. The university acknowledges that its Cape Town campus has been built on land that belongs to the people of District Six,” Staak said. The museum said the renaming should be the result of deep dialogue, while the working committee accused the university of not consulting with it. “What we want to do is involve the District Six community in this so, as the university, we have various projects in the pipeline that involve former residents,” Staak said. CPUT established a District Six task team to ensure that the reconciliatory gestures are more than just symbolic. In addition, the university is developing collaborative partnerships with the District Six Homecoming Centre and community organisations like the District Six Community Forum, St Mark’s Anglican Church and Moravian Hills Church, high schools in the area, and former residents with the aim of creating beneficial projects and initiatives. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

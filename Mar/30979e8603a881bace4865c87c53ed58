Hiemstra forms part of a group of cyclist and cancer survivors who are on their way from Joburg to Bloemfontein and will be making a stop at the Red Cross hospital, where they will speak to cancer patients and encourage them with their own stories. RELATED: Tour of Light cyclists carry cancer hope “Three of us are cancer survivors; everyone cycling has a story of someone or a family member who has had cancer. After I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the doctor gave me three weeks to live that was 30 months ago. “I decided that I can’t sit and do nothing, now it’s time to give back,” said Hiemstra. The cycle journey is taking place over eight days and started at the Grasmere toll plaza in Joburg. They have stayed overnight in Kroonstad and will stop over in Bloemfontein, Colesberg, Richmond, Beaufort West, Matjiesfontein and Paarl before entering Cape Town later this week. They have visited hospitals and cancer centres on route, such as Charlotte Maxeke hospital where they spread love and light. Red Cross is the last hospital on their list, and they plan to be joined by other cancer survivors on wheels, before handing over the money from sponsors to Cansa. “We are going to spread light and hope to cancer survivors and salute their caregivers when we cycle through our beautiful country. I am now able to tell cancer patients ‘I know what you are going through’. “Hang in there. Do not think about people who succumbed to cancer. Think of the millions who overcame it. God gave me the strength to get through cancer, and you can, too,” said Hiemstra. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

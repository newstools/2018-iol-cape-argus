They are proud to be recipients as many NGOs struggle to survive. “I feel ecstatic. We’ve been in existence since 1983 and the centre really needs funds,” co-ordinator of the centre Faldiela de Vries said. She said many NGO’s were struggling to survive as a result of the economy. RELATED: Big Walk’s recipe for great partnership The centre offers programmes for the community, including a feeding scheme from Monday to Friday. They also have a business hub and offer office space to small businesses and the public to use for workshops. “The need for a centre like ours is vast because we are in such an impoverished area,” she said. “One of our main focuses is job creation, we want to empower youngsters and the community with skills and give them job opportunities,” she said. De Vries is one of the founding members of the centre and has found joy working there over the past 35 years. “It’s said the giver gets more joy and pleasure than the receiver, and I have found such joy helping people and enriching lives,” she said. Other beneficiaries of the Big Walk are the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Trust and the Oliver Tambo Village, a Philippi-based NGO. This year, the Cape Argus is the official media partner for the event, alongside Wholesome Bread and the producers of Jive cooldrink. De Vries said she was still deliberating whether to participate. “I think I am rather going to do the 5km,” she said. “On behalf of the management of the Manenberg People’s Centre we would like to thank everyone from the Big Walk - we are really grateful for this,” she said. The walk will start at Vlei Road opposite Cape Town Stadium and end inside the Green Point Track. Over 17 000 participants are expected at this year’s event. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

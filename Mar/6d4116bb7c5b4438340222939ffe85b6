“These 'unsafe' conditions referred to were created by the WCED through deliberate neglect and the lack of interest to improve the lot of the township residents. The 'unsafe' conditions are being used to support their reasons for learners not to remain at the school," he said. “Immoral educational injustices are still perpetrated against marginalised citizens." A school governing body member, Roseline Smith, said: "The school is nearly 50-years old. There are 89 kids in the school and the department didn’t want us to take on any more." Education MEC Debbie Schafer's spokesperson, Jessica Shelver, said vandalism, dwindling learner numbers and the cost of repairs were the reasons for the school's closure. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

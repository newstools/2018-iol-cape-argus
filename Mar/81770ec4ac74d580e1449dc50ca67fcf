The cyclists covered a whopping 216km a day as part of the 16th annual Sun City to The Table Bay Charity Cycle Tour. They stopped in Klerksdorp, Bloemhof, Kimberley, Britstown, Beaufort West, Laingsburg and Worcester along the way. The cyclists donated money and products to charity organisations en route to Cape Town, in support of the World Bicycle Relief Organisation. They also promoted the sport of cycling by donating bicycles to historically disadvantaged individuals. “Sun City is pleased to once again support the Sun City to The Table Bay Charity Cycle Tour and give the cyclists a hero’s send-off they deserve. We look forward to welcoming them back at Sun City on their return,” said Raul de Lima, general manager at Sun City. Sun International has been involved with the Sun City to The Table Bay Charity Cycle Tour since 2003 and charities supported by four of its properties, Sun City (North West), Flamingo Casino (Kimberley), Golden Valley Casino (Worcester) and The Table Bay (Western Cape) benefit from the initiative. Over the past 15 years, the tour has donated about R9 million to charity organisations. It boasts a diverse mix of cyclists of all ages, and from different countries, some as far afield as Austria and Germany. Johann Maré, materials manager at Sun City and tour organiser, who has participated in every Sun City to The Table Bay Charity Cycle Tour, will again take on the ride on a tandem bike. Cape Argus

On September 10 last year, six young women drawn from different parts of India, and bonded to a common dream, were flagged off by Indiaâ€™s Defence Minister on board a 17m sailing vessel - the INSV Tarini. They arrived in Cape Town on March 2 and left on Wednesday to begin the last long leg of their epic voyage. During their stay in Cape Town, the crew members had several engagements, including formal calls on local leadership, media interaction, receptions and interaction with students at the University of Western Cape. Cultural Affairs and Sport MEC Anroux Marais attended a special farewell for them at the Royal Cape Yacht Club.   The High Commissioner of India to South Africa and Lesotho, Ruchira Kamboj, and the Consul-General of India in Cape Town, Abhishek Shukla, also attended the farewell. While they were there an exhibition was held at the Royal Yacht Club where they displayed images from the voyage. It has been open to the public since the afternoon of March 5. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

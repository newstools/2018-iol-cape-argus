Mbulelo Thinta will be the master of ceremonies at this year’s event. He couldn’t be more excited he said. “It’s really a huge privilege, it’s really nice to be a narrative for the cyclists and supporters. Everyone has a story, everyone is cycling for a reason, either for something or someone,” he said. The modest 33-year-old’s relationship with the cycle tour dates back three years, when talks were already in the pipeline to have his husky and mellifluous voice behind the microphone. “I actually MCed at a trail run a few months ago and the big bosses really liked me. I feel very comfortable behind the microphone and they enjoy my energy,” he said. The race starts at the Grand Parade this Sunday. The new starting was decided upon after the organisers were forced to cancel last year’s event due to severe wind on the Foreshore - where previous tours were started. “Throughout history we’ve had some of the best ultra-cyclists in the world. Cycling is no joke and South Africa is owning this event. We show that no struggle is ever big enough, and that’s the kind of narrative they have created,” Thinta said. Thinta is an athlete who enjoys sport. “I want to inspire my little nephews to do groundbreaking things and I want to inspire everyone to live a better and healthy life,” he said. Thinta said he was keenly awaiting this year’s tour. “I am looking forward to interact with the whole spectrum of the event, from the elite athletes to all types of characters,” he said. The Cape Town Cycle Tour’s expo opens today at Cape Town Stadium. The expo is the largest cycling, fitness and healthy lifestyle exhibition, showcasing more than 300 exhibitors and attended by approximately 70 000 visitors over the three-day period. Participants are able to register and collect their goody bags along with their race packs as they gear up for the biggest cycling event in the world. @MarvinCharles  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

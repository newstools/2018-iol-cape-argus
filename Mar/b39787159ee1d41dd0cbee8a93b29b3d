The funds will be used to upgrade the ICU unit from a 22-bed unit into a 39-bed unit with 10 additional high-care beds for babies and eight isolation cubicles. Hospital trust head of fund-raising Chantel Cooper said Abriella was one of several donors who helped the hospital make their dream come true. “(Donors) ensure thousands of sick and injured children receive high-quality care.” Abriella said she could not contain herself because she had been waiting for such a long time to hand the money over. “I've been working so hard and I could finally give the money. I know that it's going to the right cause and those children will get the best help they possibly can.” @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

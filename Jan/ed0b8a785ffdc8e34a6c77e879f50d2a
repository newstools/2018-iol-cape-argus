The victim, along with three other people, was approached by three men on a Metrorail train en route to Steenberg on Saturday. One of the suspects had a knife. To avoid being robbed, the victim apparently jumped from the moving train but died on the tracks between False Bay and Lakeside train stations. According to Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott, train traffic was then 
halted. “Metrorail responded operationally to terminate trains to Steenberg. Limited bus services were offered to commuters to transport them to Muizenberg and Steenberg stations.” At publication time, Metrorail Rapid Response was still planning how their resources would be deployed. “However, the Metrorail Protection Services investigation team will work closely with police to aid in their investigation,” Scott said. According to police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana, a case has been opened and is under investigation by Muizenberg police. “No arrests have been made as yet pertaining to the incident,” he said.

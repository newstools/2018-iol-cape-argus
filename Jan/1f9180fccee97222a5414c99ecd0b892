With the City facing a water crisis, no water will be distributed along the route. Participants will receive their own water bottles in goodie bags along with other sponsored items. Nicole Lincoln from Red Cross Children’s Hospital said they were very grateful to be a beneficiary. “After an 18-year partnership, we’ve received just over R2million, which has been benefiting ICU, radiology 
and burns wards. This year's contributions will go directly to the oncology ward,” she said. Ryan van Wyk from Wholesome Bread, the main sponsor of this year’s event, said the company wanted to help make big changes to the lives of those who would benefit from the walk. Other big sponsors include Jive Cooldrinks, now in its 13th year of being part of the walk. Aziz Hartley, editor of the Cape Argus,  the main media partner, said the walk deserved to be put on a bigger scale. It resonated with what the paper stood for, bringing people together, he said. CTBW entry forms will be published in the paper from Monday. “This can be the biggest public walking event in the country,” Hartley said. Mayco member for social services JP Smith said the City sponsored the walk to the tune of R100000 in the form of services. “We will look into investing more into this event in the future as we can see that it has the ability to bring the people of Cape Town closer together, which is the ultimate goal,” he said. At Tuesday’s launch, walk ambassador Malikah Hamza, 13, said: “It all starts with one step. Cape Town Big Walk can be that step for you.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

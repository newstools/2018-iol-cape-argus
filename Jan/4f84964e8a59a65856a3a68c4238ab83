This after a 39-year-old Egyptian was robbed and stabbed nine times on Sunday. The incident brought to 17 the number of muggings in that area, according to Table Mountain Watch. Table Mountain Watch spokesperson Andre van Schalkwyk said: “Without a shadow of a doubt, people should not go there. It would be irresponsible not to warn people about the life-threatening area, rather let them risk their lives knowing the possible dangers. "These incidents could have been prevented years ago if there were long-term solutions. It is frustrating that there are no rangers or visible policing in the area despite countless attacks”, Van Schalkwyk said. Lion’s Head, Silvermine, Sandy Bay and Noordhoek were among the areas that have been flagged as a crime hot spot along with nearby Karbonkelberg. Regional SANParks spokeswoman Merle Collins has poured cold water on the claims and insisted visitors and locals should ignore this as the area is safe. “Crime is a challenge in the City of Cape Town and across South Africa and it does on occasion spill over into the natural and remote areas on the Peninsula. Table Mountain National Park has appointed a dedicated Visitor Safety Team, the role of which is to keep crime to a minimum in the national park. As a result, since 2010 contact crime in the park has dropped significantly,” Collins said.  She said rangers and visitor safety rangers were monitoring the area. The teams were supported by a dog unit. Van Schalkwyk said their request since August for public safety to be reviewed had landed on deaf ears. They are considering approaching the high court to force officials to beef up security. On December 30, an Austrian couple, Klaus, 63, and Johanna Michl ,63, were interrupted by a knife-wielding man while strolling at Noordhoek Beach. He fled with the couple’s backpack which had travel documents, a camera and valuables inside.  @okuhle_hlati   okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

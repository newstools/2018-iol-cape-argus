According to Trevor Edben, Greenmarket Square Traders’ Association chairperson, prostitution in the area has been rife for several years. “When I come to open my business, prostitutes are often sitting on the corner. They shoot-up on heroin in broad daylight, and this is bad for business. Customers are driven away, because they feel uncomfortable and fearful.” Bryan Wilson has been operating his hair salon there for 18 years, and agrees. According to him, it is impossible to maintain his livelihood with no support from security in the Square. “The Central City Improvement District (CCID) responds fairly quickly when there is a theft or something similar, but Eden Security officers are no help at all,” he said. According to CCID communications manager Carola Koblitz, several meetings have been held between the Greenmarket Traders’ Association and the City to address the concerns of business owners. Koblitz said Eden Security was deployed by the City and was not under the jurisdiction of CCID patrol. A CCID officer confirmed there were few Eden security officers on duty in the square. “We serve from Shortmarket to Burg Street, then from Burg to Long Street. If anything happens in Greenmarket Square, we don’t hesitate to respond, but only in the capacity of supporting Eden officers,” he said. Suzette Little, mayoral committee member of Area North, said the need for a more integrated approach to security at Greenmarket Square was identified in October last year. “A meeting was held between Eden and the Area Economic Development Department in November, where security measures were discussed. The City agreed resources deployed by Eden were inadequate. We also requested a risk assessment which confirmed the resources were inadequate,” said Little. Eden Security declined to comment.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

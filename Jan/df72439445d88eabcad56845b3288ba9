Former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates defender Mark Fish was left 'out of water' on Tuesday, after his tribute to jazz legend Hugh Masekela started trending for all the wrong reasons. Fish uploaded a snap of himself with Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse when he paid homage to Masekela on social media, but quickly removed it after Twitter red-carded him for his blunder. Fish apologised for the error and paid tribute to Masekela again, this time with the correct picture.  Twitter, however, was not so forgiving and started #MarkFishChallenge by uploading random pictures of people, while making references to someone else in the caption. Here are some of the tweets:   Bra Hugh whith Bra Hugh #MarkFishChallenge pic.twitter.com/s7pFejSak0  â€” ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ Doctor's Advocate ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ (@ZingisaNgcongo3) January 24, 2018   A rare picture of Steve Hofmeyer and Ntsiki Mazwai #MarkFishChallenge pic.twitter.com/dvHlxQLsjN  â€” Xolani Wale Kenhuk (@XolanWaleKenhuk) January 24, 2018   #MarkFishChallenge                                    Black Coffee pic.twitter.com/PbcOLo33oE  â€” Mochoari Thabang (@MochoariT) January 24, 2018

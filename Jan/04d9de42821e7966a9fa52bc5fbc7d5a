The surrogate carrying reality TV star Kim Kardashian West and her husband Kanye West's third child is reportedly set to give birth "any day now". The celebrity couple - who already have four-year-old daughter North and two-year-old son Saint - are said to be very excited about the impending arrival of the child and "can't wait to bring their baby home". READ: Kim Kardashian on a quest to lose belly fat Kim, 37, suffered complications with her two pregnancies, experiencing early-onset preeclampsia with North and further troubles during labour with Saint. However, on this occasion, Kim won't have any such worries and she's determined to take a proactive approach from the outset. A source told Entertainment Tonight: "She'll be hands-on from the beginning." The arrival of the couple's baby will not be filmed for Kim's reality TV show, 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' and Kim and Kanye have done their best to ensure the privacy of their surrogate. An insider previously said: "The surrogate's comfort and safety is incredibly important to [Kim and Kanye]." Meanwhile, Kim previously admitted that she's found the surrogacy experience to be markedly different to her pregnancies. But Kim insisted the experience of having a surrogate has also proven to be stressful. The brunette beauty shared: "Anyone that says or thinks it is just the easy way out is just completely wrong. I think it is so much harder to go through it this way, because you are not really in control. And, you know, obviously you pick someone that you completely trust and that you have a good bond and relationship with, but ... knowing that I was able to carry my first two babies and not my baby now, it's hard for me.Â  "So, it's definitely a harder experience than I anticipated just in the control area."

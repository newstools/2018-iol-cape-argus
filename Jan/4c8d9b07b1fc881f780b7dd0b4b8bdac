On Wednesday the organisation packed the goods to be distributed to the 640 people who lost most of their possessions in the fire on Boxing Day. Mustadafin, based in  Lansdowne, took it on themselves to help the community get back on their  feet. It has collected products and cash to provide food. Ghairunisa Johnstone-Cassiem, director of Mustadafin, said they had been serving the community since 1986: “The community of Valhalla Park lies close to our hearts.” The NGO has 22 volunteers from all walks of life, including a group from Grabouw.  “We had a sit-down Christmas lunch for the group while we were in Grabouw recently,’’ said  Nazlie Behardien, communications liaison officer for Mustadafin.  “When they heard about what we were doing for the 7de Laan fire victims, they wanted to help.” The food parcels contain basic foods, such as baked beans, maize, flour and oil, enough to "carry the families through". The NGO relies on donations from individuals and companies, and has paid for some of the food out of their own pockets.  It is also requesting donations of stationery and school clothes. Mustadafin will distribute food parcels at 2.30pm at the Valhalla Park Civic Hall. To donate visit www.mustadafin.org.za Cape Argus

They demand that train services on the Central line be suspended until their members' safety is guaranteed. This after a security guard was shot dead by unidentified suspects during an armed robbery at the Chris Hani station in Khayelitsha. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder had been opened following a shooting where a 50-year-old security guard was fatally injured.  Untu general secretary Steve Harris said traumatised Prasa Metrorail guard Christelle Meyer, 41, who was being escorted by the 50-year-old security guard, had just recovered from an attack three weeks back. “At the Heideveld train station two men pointed at her and her armed guard with a firearm. She was forced to fall down. When the train stopped at the Chris Hani station at about 6pm, Meyer and her guard had to leave it at the turnaround back to Cape Town. She saw there was a commotion at the cabin of the train driver, where he and his armed guard got out. The next moment she heard a shot,” Harris said. He said when Meyer turned around she found the armed guard shot. He died instantly. “We request that there be trained armed security on the stations to help prevent an incident like last night from happening again," Harris said.  "Not until there is trained security or they are armed are we prepared to work under these conditions.” He said at platforms that did have security, they were armed only with a baton. Metrorail said they had plans to erect a security fence worth about R68million to improve security on the route, but Harris was sceptical. “We aren’t convinced that the wall will be a solution. If you look along the highways where similar walls have been built the walls are broken down,” Harris said. Regional manager Richard Walker said service remained suspended on the Central line. He said they were looking at getting police to drive along Central line, “escorting” trains.  @okuhle_hlati   okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

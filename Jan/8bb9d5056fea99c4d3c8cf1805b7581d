Based on highly successful programmes in London, New York and Amsterdam, this caffeinated event was going to showcase Cape Town as one of the coffee capitals in the world. Many were heartsore of the news that the festival had been postponed: Shane King said: "Surely an event can be arranged for 2018. Why a whole year? Quality event organisers should be able to arrange even if the demand is high." Theresa Gosling said: "Maybe you shouldn't trust the stars....they know nothing." Many others couldn't help but share their disappointment asking why the event was pushed to 2019. Heather King, spokesperson for the The Cape Town Coffee Festival, did extend their apologies and explained that the decision was made in a bid to bring an even better festival. "We took the decision to postpone our debut festival in Cape Town for a variety of different reasons - however we feel that this decision will allow us to present the best possible version of the event," she said. "We have yet to confirm the final dates and venue, but what we do know is that we’re 100% committed to hosting this event in 2019." @thelionmutters  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

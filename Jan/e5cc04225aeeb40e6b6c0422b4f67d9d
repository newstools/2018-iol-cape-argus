“We are especially struggling to accommodate learners in Grades 1 and 8 as they make up 68% of the learners in need of placement still,” said Western Cape Minister of Education, Debbie Schäfer. “Our officials worked tirelessly with schools during the third and fourth terms last year to place as many learners as possible, as the amount of learners has decreased drastically from 19910 in December 2017.”   Despite implementing a placement plan to accommodate continued growth, Schäfer added: “The challenge arises when people move to the province without planning in advance, or without enrolling their children at a school. Parents also had to apply for places in 2018 by last year March 24."  Schäfer said parents could not be guaranteed their first school of choice if their children had not yet been placed.  “Parents should accept places they have been offered, or apply to schools that the district advises them to apply to. The majority of our schools have indicated that they are full. We can only refer parents to schools where there is availability,” she said.  @tamryn_christ Cape Argus

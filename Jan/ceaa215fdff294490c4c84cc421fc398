Daniel said he was very excited about playing at the event and his dad, Danny Petersen, said he was busy rehearsing with his South African band for the event. “As a father I am very proud of the fact that he has been honoured to perform at such an auspicious and landmark event. I’m without wordsI can still clearly remember when he was only 14 months old and I came home one day to find him playing the drums. That is when I decided to teach him to play drums,” he said. The young drummer has also started the Daniel Petersen III Foundation, where he helps underprivileged children who do not have musical instruments. And he has provided training in music to thousands of young children. “Daniel’s performance will be a collaboration between his South African band and his US musicians. Daniel’s sister Robyn is the lead singer in his band. I want to thank Danno’s new US-based manager Katana Alexander from K&O Media, who made this possible,” his father said. Daniel said: “It’s my dream to also receive a Grammy Award one day. This is the first time I will be playing at such an event. I am excited to meet all the people, who I always dreamt about seeing one day. “Also, to be chosen to perform is just mind-blowing.” Last year, Daniel received the Barack Obama Lifetime Achievement Award. He received the award for his commitment to nation building and community work. In 2014 he became the youngest person to obtain a degree in music at the University of the Western Cape. He has been playing drums since the age of 3. Daniel will also be rolling out a South African countrywide tour with his 15-piece Collector’s Series DW Drum kit next month. “This drum kit was launched by the president of DW drums, Don Lombardi, on the drum channel in Los Angeles last year,” his father said. “It’s to motivate learners in urban and rural communities reach their full potential. We want him to motivate and inspire more children through music.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Her father, Pierre Bredell, who was by her side during the swim, confirmed that she raised R133 000 as she swam 8km in three hours and eight minutes. Bredell said the family had travelled to Cape Town twice every month for the past two years so Abriella could train. “I am very proud of Abriella. She even trained during the coldest times in winter. “She is very young and I commend her for her bravery. This was something that she purposed in her heart. Although part of her goal was to set a new world record as the world’s youngest person to participate in this type of initiative, she did it for the children and only she herself grasps that more than anything,” he said. He added that she still had another R1.8 million to raise. “If 1.8 million people could just donate R1 to this initiative, we would reach our goal.” “People need to understand the bigger picture. The donations are for the children. It’s like making an investment into our future because they are our future,” he said. Abriella’s mother Lauryn said she was very proud of her daughter, especially for her hard work and sacrifice. “It was hard to watch, but it was worth raising the funds for the hospital,” she said. Abriella's parents also confirmed that, among other requests, she was invited to swim the English Channel for a similar charity event. “We are happy and excited about the responses from all across the world. Our main focus now, however, is to get that R2m to the children’s hospital,” said her father. To date more than R200000 has been raised for the Back-a-buddy campaign.

The duo and their company, Megahit Productions, will be travelling to Nigeria and the US later this year to shoot a music video with Best Afropop Producer Kiddominant. The group, together for the past two years, said: “We believe in creating our own opportunities. We also want to prove that music can be more lucrative for more local artists than people think,” said Aurel. Aurel, who has experienced living on the streets before moving into a foster home, said his experience has pushed him to strive for success. “My mother died when I was very young. After being physically and verbally abused by my dad, I decided to run away from home. I believe that that's where it all started. My journey up until now is what I want to bring across through the greatest platform in the art industry. I also chose this path because I love literature,” he said. Mostert, whose parents are former drug dealers, said he wanted to lead a different life from that of his parents. “My parents are now reformed and I am grateful for that. After working closely with the youth in my community, I decided to take things one step further by positively influencing them through music,” he said. “Everything we do is self-produced. From the camera work to the editing, to writing our own lyrics,” said Aurel. Megahit Productions will be performing at Bleach in Blouberg on January 26 and also at the Poole Lounge on January 30.

Twenty years ago the families initiated the Ruo Emoh housing project, but due to funding constraints, the building of the housing project could not be completed.  By September last year the families had built a boundary wall around the site, built the roads, and installed the electricity, the stormwater pipes and the sewerage systems. Last year the City of Cape Town released the housing subsidies to the recipients and the housing began.  Before this the families stayed in the backyards of other people. They complained about not having their own kitchens and toilets.  Nazneen Salie, 35, who used to stay in a wendy house next to a farm in Philippi, said: “I finally have my dream house, after 16 years. As a family we dreamt about having our own house. My three children can now have their own room. It is a blessing from God.”  Chairperson of the steering committee for the housing project, Adnaan Hendricks, said people were very happy about the houses.  “The great thing is we also have a borehole. The water will be used for outside and to flush our toilets,” he said. The oldest woman who received a house was Janap Whisgary, 61. “I did not have a house before. The day I got my keys I cried. For the first two nights in my new house I could not sleep, that is how excited I was.  “Before, I lived in Rocklands, Mitchells Plain, with my children. But I always wanted my own kitchen and toilet. I am very happy,” she said.  Fatima Samaai, 47, who lived in a backyard for 17 years, said she felt blessed.  “We went from having a small wendy house to a two-bedroom house,” she said. “I waited 13 years for my house. My 62-year-old uncle and child will also be staying with us. For the for first time I can cook in a beautiful kitchen and take a bath!”    argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

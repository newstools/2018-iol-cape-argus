The United National Transport Union (Untu), which represents most train drivers, said the union would meet with the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) on Wednesday to discuss their grievances regarding safety on the notorious line. Last Monday, Metrorail suspended services on the Central line after a security guard was shot dead by unidentified suspects during an armed robbery at the Chris Hani station in Khayelitsha. Untu general secretary Steve Harris said the railway route had become a life-threatening working environment: “The route has become a war zone controlled by criminals who continue to vandalise the deteriorated remaining infrastructure daily. The route will be suspended until our members safety is guaranteed." Untu had demanded that Prasa  arrange an urgent meeting with their CEO, Cromet Molepo, the Commissioner of Police in the Western Cape, and all other stakeholders, about the safety of their members and commuters who use the line, and the meeting was arranged for Wednesday. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott confirmed that the central train services were still closed, as labour issues remained unresolved. “Current alternative arrangements continue. No single, returns, weekly tickets will be sold and monthly train ticket holders may use Golden Arrow buses off-peak (after 8.30am and again after 6pm),” Scott said. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said rail commuters should brace themselves for longer commuting times in 2018. Congress for Democratic Taxi Associations' spokesperson Andile Khanyi said regular taxi commuters would be affected, as increased traffic congestion would make them late for work.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

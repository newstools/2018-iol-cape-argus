Spine Road High was the only “township” school in the Western Cape to have attained a 100% pass rate and among only three other schools in the Southern district, alongside Wynberg Boys and Wynberg Girls, to do so.  “I am extremely ecstatic about the result,” Spine Road High School principal Riyaadh Najaar said through tears of joy.  “The praise goes firstly to the Almighty who has carried us through, then to the teachers for their hard work and sacrifice and also to the learners who played their part.” The high school also managed to attain a 100% pass rate for maths and English for the first time in the school's existence. “We knew that they would do well but not this well. We are over the moon,” he said.

She deserves this moment.”  Cape Argus

Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the line will not be operational until further notice. “Technicians continue to do repair work and communication regarding the opening of the line will be relayed once the line has been opened, after all the necessary safety tests have been done.” The United National Transport Union (Untu) forced the suspension of the line as a security guard was shot dead during an armed robbery at the Chris Hani station in Khayelitsha two weeks ago. After the union reached an agreement with Prasa, plans to reopen the route from Chris Hani to Mitchells Plain were postponed due to vandalism at Bonteheuwel electricity substation and Nyanga. Public Transport Voice (PTV) spokesperson Dalton Ndongeni said they met with Metrorail management, who are planning to address the public and inform them about the impact of vandalism and crime on services. “It is really a pity that commuters have to suffer like this, I am also among those who used the train. Commuters have been coming to me as they are frustrated and there is nothing I can really do. We all want the Central Line to open as soon as possible, but don't want to put people's lives at risk and not check if the line and signals are all working.” He said pamphlets would be sent to communities to educate them and hopefully that would work. An agreement between Prasa, Untu and police will see the deployment of hundreds of police officers to patrol the Central Line. @okuhle_hlati  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

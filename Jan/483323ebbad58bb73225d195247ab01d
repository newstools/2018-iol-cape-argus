The school sent out a letter to parents informing them that it has been approached by the City’s disaster management team with the intention of using it as a water collection point should day zero be reached. According to the City’s executive director for safety and security, Richard Bosman, proposed water collection points have not been finalised. “Once this process has been completed, the public will be informed of the locations of the sites. Some water collection sites, where possible, will be open to the public 24 hours a day. “In the case of schools, the City and its partners will ensure that disruptions to education are minimised,” said Bosman. Mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services and snergy councillor Xanthea Limberg said the plans are in place to assess and finalise water distribution points,  however, she said  the city could still avoid Day Zero if every resident ensures they use no more than 87 litres per day. Bergvliet High principal Stephen Price said he had no problem with the City using the area at the school as a collection point and it won’t affect the pupils. In a letter to parents, Price also stipulated other water saving measures to be implemented at the school would include toilets only being open before school, during break and after school; pupils and staff being required to bring their own bottled water to school and having one hand basin tap per bathroom. “Many kids already bring water bottles to school, there is water for those with medical conditions. The regulations are to manage consumption, not stop it,”said Price. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer’s spokesperson, Jessica Shelver, acknowledged the letter sent out by the school and said:  “Many of our schools are already implementing water saving measures and are including education on the drought and water saving in their lessons. We are adopting a ‘whole of society’ approach to the water crisis.”  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

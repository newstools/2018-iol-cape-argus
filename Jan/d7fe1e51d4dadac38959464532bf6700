The organisation donated a 5000-litre water storage tank to the Ikhaya Garden Project and has filled it with non-potable water, purely to keep essential initiatives alive.  “Due to the water crisis we’ve been unable to irrigate our gardens and it has been so disappointing to watch all our years of hard work go to waste,” Bangani said. Bangani has been working with over 150 household gardens in Site C, mostly owned by young people, who used to host food events such as Disco Soup, Eat In and Impilo Yabantu Food Market, but were now struggling to produce any vegetables at all.  “Over 100 youth who have been involved in this one garden learnt about environmental awareness, indigenous and medicinal plants and establishing a large successful vegetable garden which has won many awards over the years,” he said. “I wanted to create an eco-friendly, green environment within this area and encourage youth from the community and school to adopt a green lifestyle and teach them simple farming techniques and education about our environment,” he added.  “We believe these micro-farming initiatives to be essential to the informal communities in so many ways, through education, food security, food safety, income generation, social and emotional well-being and so much more.  “We simply cannot allow these projects to die," said Shelley Humphreys, spokesperson for Water4CapeTown.

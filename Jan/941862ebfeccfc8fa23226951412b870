Traffic Services said the suspect evaded a roadblock in Blackheath on Tuesday, so they chased after him. He was eventually caught when he had to stop at the Buttskop Railway Crossing. Then, after he was loaded into the Traffic Services patrol vehicle, he again tried to escape, but was caught a second time. Traffic officers ran his name through eNatis, the Electronic National Traffic Administration Information System, and discovered he had 26 outstanding warrants, so he was immediately arrested, and held at Bluedowns police station. He appeared in court on Wednesday and was remanded to Goodwood Prison. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said: “We will continue to conduct roadblocks and will apprehend all suspects with outstanding warrants. Those who infringe on traffic laws will be punished.” Cape Argus

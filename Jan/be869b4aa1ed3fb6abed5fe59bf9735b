Cape Town - Long-serving City of Cape Town city manager Achmat Ebrahim has resigned. In a circular sent out to City staff, Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille confirmed that Ebrahim tended his resignation with effect from January 12, 2018. "His last working day was 12 January 2018. In his resignation letter Ebrahim made it clear that he is able to quite easily defend the allegations made against him in the Bowman Gilfillan report. "He further stated that in terms of the ongoing investigations, he would furnish my office with copies of all the evidence files as it pertains to his involvement in these allegations which have already been handed to Bowman Gilfillan and which clearly show that the allegations against him are baseless," De Lille said. "After almost 40 years of dedicated and loyal service, he stated in his letter that his obvious primary consideration at this stage of his life was that of his personal and familyâ€™s wellbeing. Ebrahim expressed his thanks for the excellent leadership and political guidance stating it was a tremendous honour for him to serve with me as the Mayor," De Lille said.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

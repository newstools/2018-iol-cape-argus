Stephan Botes, 60, alleged Zackey attacked him on Saturday, on the dance floor of Club 31, after an altercation. Zackey, 24, from Boksburg appeared in  court after Botes made a case against him for beating him with an unknown object. Botes, who is retired, was left with cuts on his face and required micro surgery, which he received over the weekend. According to Botes, he had been drinking at the bar when Zackey arrived and slapped his drink from his hand. He claims to have done nothing to provoke Zackey, who later allegedly pushed on the dance floor before attacking him. “I didn’t do a damn thing. I don’t know him from a bar of soap, he deliberately slapped the drink in my hand and he viciously assaulted me. People at the club were mortified,” Botes said. “He slapped me hard several times with a solid object and I had an open cut on my forehead and from my lower jaw across my jaw line. According to the club manager, they’ve done it before.” Club 31 management revealed nothing about the incident but said that attacks like the assault by Zackey were often experienced at the club and management were prepared to deal with it. The Cape Argus contacted Zackey on Facebook to find out his accounts of the allegd attack, but he initially maintained that we had the wrong person, before revealing that he was the accused by asking for video footage the Cape Argus 
obtained. A clerk at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court confirmed that Zackey appeared in court on Monday, and said the case was postponed to March 16. Cape Town police spokesperson Captain Ezra October confirmed that the case was opened. @IAmAthinaMay  athina.may@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

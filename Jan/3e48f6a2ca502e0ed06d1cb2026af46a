This is iStore’s out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement, in accordance with the Apple battery replacement programme. The company made the announcement following a statement from Apple regarding iPhone battery replacements in the US. In the US, Apple offers users a battery replacement for $29, which is valid for the iPhone 6 or newer. For your first time, you can get the replacement regardless of the diagnostic test results.

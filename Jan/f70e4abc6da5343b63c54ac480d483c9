“There are still people coming back from holiday and returning to Cape Town before the kids go back to school,” Payne said. “This is the one of the most dangerous times of the year, as many people are rushing home. They are no longer being vigilant because they think they are out of the ‘danger’ period. When you as a driver don’t pay attention, you are back in that danger zone. “The City of Cape Town Traffic Services have dispatched more patrols along these busy routes, and will continue with road block blitzes. The City of Cape Town Traffic Services have been coming down hard on driving offences following the large number of traffic offences that occurred during the festive season." Roadblocks were set up around Athlone, Strandfontein, Mowbray and Rondebosch, and resulted in 43 drunk-driving-related arrests. Another roadblock was set up outside the Cape Town Station Deck early yesterday morning, where eight minibus taxi drivers were apprehended for drunk driving in just one hour. One taxi driver’s alcohol intake was seven times over the legal limit. Kenny Africa, the Western Cape traffic chief, advised drivers to stay home if drinking. “Stay home when you know you are going to drink. If you are away from home, spend the night. Stay off the roads, as you are not just a danger to yourself, but to other motorists as well.” On Saturday night, seven suspects were arrested for reckless and/or negligent driving during an illegal street racing incident in Athlone. A total of  640 speed offences have been recorded along Jakes Gerwel Drive before the N2. Another 95 speed offences were recorded along Jan Smuts Drive in Athlone.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

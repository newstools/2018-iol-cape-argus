Plot:  At a top secret research facility in the 1950s, a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity. Review: The Shape of Water directed by Guillermo del Toro should, by all accounts, not be as good as it is - and yet the movie is arguably Del Toro’s best. Set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962, The Shape of Water tells the story of the lonely Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who lives a mundane live was a cleaner in a hidden high-security government laboratory. Elisa’s life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) discover a secret classified experiment. The movie doesn’t shy away from tackling a adult version of a  “Beauty and the Beast” story, giving it even more of a weird twist. However, it’s for that very reason why it’s so enjoyable. The Shape of Water manages to tackle social issues, and also gives representation to the hearing impaired community, people of colour, and even includes one gay character - who also has their own storyline. All while leaning into it’s 1960’s setting, and incorporating the challenges of that era into the movie For most filmmakers this melting pot of story could easily fall apart at the seams, but it works because of the attention to detail paid by Del Toro. Every shot has its use and builds the world, while also adding touching and subtle changes, which then results in the story having a greater impact. His work is also being recognised as he recently won Best Director for Motion Picture and Best Original Score for a Motion Picture at the 75th Golden Globe awards. It would be very easy to ramble on about the film, but one of the perks of watching it was not knowing too much about it, so be mindful of spoilers, but definitely add The Shape of Water to your must-watch list.

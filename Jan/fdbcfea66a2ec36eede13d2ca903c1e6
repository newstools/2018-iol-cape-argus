For Tasneem Cookson, 16, from Hanover Park, this dream has came true. She will be representing South Africa at the 2018 Dr Pepper Dallas Cup in March, the oldest and most prestigious international youth soccer tournament in the US. Her mother, Shireen Wilson, 36, has been working hard to make sure her daughter doesn’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “The last thing I want is to disappoint her, I know how passionate and talented she is," Wilson said.  "She was so excited when I broke the news to her. This could also open other doors for her. It is special as she will be going abroad for the first time.”  Wilson said that through the assistance of her community, private sponsors, and fund-raising karaokies at home, they managed to secure her ticket, which cost R27 500. “My community was with me through it all. A local crèche helped, people had beach trips and I sold clothes.  "Tasneem only needs money for few things now, people can continue supporting us," she said. The Grade 11 pupil at Groenvlei High has been playing soccer since age 9 and has represented Western Province and the South African Football Association on many occasions. A thrilled Tasneem thanked all who helped her, especially her grandparents. “My grandparents also did their utmost to see I go and make them proud. They saved money and bought me a new pair of boots. I just want others who were chosen with me to make it. Some are still in need of funds and hopefully they get assisted,” Tasneem said.  @okuhle_hlati   okulhe.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

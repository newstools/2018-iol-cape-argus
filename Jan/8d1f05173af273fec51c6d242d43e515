Madikizela, who is also human settlements MEC, used the resignation on Monday of City manager Achmat Ebrahim to attack De Lille in a media statement. RELATED: Madikizela to ‘take over’ from #DeLille Ebrahim resigned amid allegations of corruption cover-ups and maladministration fingering himself, City transport commissioner Melissa Whitehead and De Lille . “It is regrettable that by his own admission Mr Ebrahim was directly requested by mayor De Lille not to disclose the fact that he had resigned on Friday. "This means that a material fact relating to the City was deliberately withheld by mayor De Lille at the time that the DA 's federal executive was deliberating on her matter,” Madikizela said. Khaya Yozi, the ANC's Cape Town spokesperson, hit back on social media saying Madikizela’s statement was an attempt at seeking relevance,while his corruption probe in the legislature was pending. He should not be speaking out against the mayor, Yozi pointed out. De Lille has denied Madikizela's claims. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

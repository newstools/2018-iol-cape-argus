Founding director Ingrid Burger said the main purpose of the pageant was to provide an opportunity for women and children to focus on using their talents to make an impact on their communities. “These pageants are not about appearances and glamour, but community and character - 70% of the contestants’ scores are allocated on the basis of their community projects and panel interviews,” she said. Anita du Preez, 47, crowned Ms Hope Elite International, said “I did not expect it, but I am extremely grateful". Among other initiatives, Du Preez is involved in Child Welfare, does outreach to children diagnosed with cancer and works on Calvinia farms, where she sources funds, feeds, supplies and transport to farmers in drought-stricken areas. The winners of each category received a study bursary from Oxbridge Academy and the opportunity to use Hope as a platform to enhance their projects. “I have not decided yet what I would study with the bursary,” said Du Preez. Anri Buys, 34, from the Free State,  crowned Ms Hope International, said: “My projects is empowering women and families in poor communities by helping them in any emotional situation as well as financial need. I started a free stimulation school for the children under 10 who can’t afford school.” Buys gave her bursary to study to Miss Free State, who was first runner-up in her category. @tamryn_christ  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

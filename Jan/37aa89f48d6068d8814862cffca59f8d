But music sensation Oshri Elmorich, 24, can. And he’s signed on for Akon’s label, Konvict Muzik. Born in Israel, but calling Cape Town home since 2010, Oshri ticks all the right boxes as a pop star.  Not only is he a charmer on the mic, but he’s also a real ladies man with his perfectly toned body and pretty boy looks. Known for his popular tracks Bad Reputation and Crazy But Free, Oshri was hand-picked by US pop / R&B star Akon to perform at the Trace Urban Music Awards in Paris in 2015. Oshri had made a name for himself by winning the Trace Music Stars competition in 2014. With this launchpad, Oshri moved from Cape Town to New York to pursue a full-time music career under the watchful eye of another superstar, Wyclef Jean.  Oshri now splits his time between LA, New York and Cape Town, where he is working on new material with Jimmy Nevis. The two had also collaborated on the track Bad Reputation. “I believe I have a responsibility as an artist to deliver a message, and not just share my stories,” says Oshri.  “We should elevate our spirits by being good and doing good, believing there is a greater power and picture behind it all.” His latest single, Too Much, is about the pressure women are under to always look their best with tons of make-up, which he feels is over the top.    venecia.valentine@inl.co.za   Daily Voice

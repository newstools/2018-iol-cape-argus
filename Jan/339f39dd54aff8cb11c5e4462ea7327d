The Manenberg Community Police Forum arranged the event to celebrate the successes of the Class of 2017 and to inspire future pupils and show that positivity can be found in the gang-ravaged community. According to CPF chairperson Adul Kader Jacobs, the event would be held annually. “Whenever there is a shooting in the area, it is in the papers the very next day. The pupils of Manenberg are surrounded by negativity and are judged because of where they come from. The CPF will host this event each year to highlight that your circumstances do not determine where you are headed in life.” Matriculants beamed as they were showcased to the community, starting at Phoenix High School. Jacobs said they the matriculants would serve as a beacon of hope for other pupils who would still do matric as well as those pupils who had been unsuccessful in their final year of school. “I want this event to show parents how important supporting their children is. “These matriculants will build our community up, and that is the ultimate goal,” he said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Maimane also said the City had secured an extra 67 million litres from the Pal- miet-Kogelberg Dam to come on line early next month, as part of the 120 million-litre augmentation. Last week it was expected that this additional capacity would only come on line by May, but now more than half will be available from early February. “This speeding-up of water augmentation will help us greatly to Defeat Day Zero. This water will be transferred from the Palmiet-Kogelberg Dam, which has had excellent rainfall and is full. This has been a collaborative effort from the farming community of the Elgin-Grabouw valley and the City of Cape Town,” he said. Maimane said that over the coming weeks the City would be reducing pressure in high use areas across the city. “This means that residents will start to experience a noticeable drop in pressure for most of the day, and those in high-lying areas and in apartment blocks may have water service interruption for several hours at a time. People should not be alarmed or panic when this happens, and should plan accordingly,” he said. Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson said the planned desalination plants are set to continue. “The building plans for the plants are still ongoing. A large part of the work is constructed off-site while they are busy with outlet pipes that will go into the sea. All these plans are on track and we will have the projects add to the augmentation schemes,” he said. Local Government MEC, Anton Bredel  said the average level for dams across the Western Cape for the week starting January 22 was 24.4%. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

Cape Town is running out of this most precious resource and we’ve all been asked to do what we can to stave off Day Zero - the day the taps run dry. Dam levels would have reached 13.5% capacity. Water consumers, old and young, rich and poor, of all races, religions and creeds will then have to queue for their allocated 25 litres of water a day. In the face of this looming nightmare, there have been distinct reactions: there are the naysayers who believe the water  crisis is a fabricated plot manipulated by politicians, there are people pointing  fingers at government saying something should’ve been done sooner to deal with the crisis. These critics may have a point. Some consumers have also been fingered for wastage and not doing enough to help save water. None of this is going to stop Day Zero. What would help avoid Day Zero is for all of us to change our attitudes towards water and how we use it. We need to treat it as the precious resource it is. On Friday, the Cape Argus newspaper launches the #EveryDropCounts campaign. No amount of moaning or finger-pointing will bring more water. However, if we all pull together, we can change the city’s water culture and adapt to being a water-scarce area. We will provide you with tips, resources and information about how you can help be the change Cape Town needs. Some of the country’s icons, captains of industry and social activists have agreed to back our drive to educate Capetonians on the value of saving water. You too can be a part of the campaign.

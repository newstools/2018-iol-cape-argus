Residents suspect that illegal connections caused the fire. City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Theo Layne said that the cause of Saturday’s fire was unknown and “45 informal structures were destroyed and no fatalities were reported”. Mayoral committee member for safety and security and social services JP Smith confirmed that the City’s disaster and rescue team has already given affected residents starter packs to rebuild their homes. “The standard procedures will 
be followed. The rebuilding of 
homes usually takes less than a day,” he said. Charlotte Powell from the City’s Disaster Risk Management Centre said that NGO, the Mustadafin Foundation has provided the victims with hot meals, clothes and other basic necessities. “Most of the people who were left destitute are staying with friends and family while others have moved into their new homes after the City’s solid waste department removed all the waste as a result of the fire,” she said.

Honolulu - Adult website Pornhub said there was an increase in traffic after Hawaii residents received a false missile alarm. On Saturday January 13 at about 8:07am, residents in Hawaii received an alert informing them that a ballistic missile was incoming and were advised to take shelter. This alert turned out to be false, prompting an uproar from the Hawaiian and global community. According to pornographic website, Pornhub, there was a drop in traffic immediately after the alert and by 8:23, traffic was a -77% 'below that of a typical Saturday'. However, when residents were told that the message was a mistake, traffic returned to normal and then increased remarkably. "As residents were notified around 8:45 that the initial warning was sent in error, traffic began to return to normal and Hawaiians collectively breathed a sigh of relief. Those seeking further relief, headed back to Pornhub where pageviews surged +48% above typical levels at 9:10," said Pornhub in a statement. "We can’t begin to imagine what would go through someone’s mind after reading that message, but based purely on the traffic numbers, it’s NOT to be watching porn.” IOL

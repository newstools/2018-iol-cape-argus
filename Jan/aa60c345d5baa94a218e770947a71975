Cape Town - Organisers of the iconic Cape Town Cycle Tour are working to ensure they have a "zero" water footprint amid the Western Cape's water crisis. Tour director David Bellairs said rumours that the 2018 Cape Town Cycle Tour has been postponed or cancelled as a result of the severe water shortages in the Western Cape, are unfounded and not true. “The Cape Town Cycle Tour Management Team has been working tirelessly over the last year, looking at ways to ensure this iconic event can take place. A comprehensive plan is in place with all our suppliers and service providers to ensure that we reduce our reliance and impact on the municipal water supply to as close to 0% as possible. We believe this is achievable and are making every effort to meet this goal. “We will also be asking all participants traveling to Cape Town to please support us in our efforts to conserve water during their stay in the Mother City. All participants will receive communications prior to the event to ensure that they fully understand the severity of the crisis and we will provide practical tips on how they can do their part,” says Bellairs. Eliminating the event’s reliance on municipal drinking water will be achieved through a variety of strategies and solutions including:
•    The use of grey water
•    The use of de-salinated water
•    Spring water brought in from outside the City of Cape Town
•    Chemical toilets & hand sanitisers
•    No shower facilities will be provided "As an event that has always prided itself on its proactive and responsible approach to environmental matters, we will do everything possible to ensure that our events’ water footprint has a negligible impact on our precious water resource – while still delivering a world-class event," the organisers said in a statement. The entire net surplus of the Cycle Tour is distributed to the Rotary Club of Claremont and the Pedal Power Association. “The cost of the water strategy will mean that the Cape Town Cycle Tour’s contribution to charity will possibly be slightly less in 2018,” said Bellairs. “But we feel strongly that the event must go ahead, as many of these charities rely on this income for their projects, not to mention the significant positive economic impact the Cycle Tour has for the city and the province.” The Cape Town Cycle Tour #40take2 will be staged on 11 March 2018, with a new start at the Grand Parade Precinct.

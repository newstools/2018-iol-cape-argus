Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said that a 27-year-old man, was gunned down outside a shop in Athwood Walk on Sunday. It is alleged the man belonged to one of the dominant gangs in Hanover Park and was killed by a member of a rival gang over a personal fall out that happened over the festive season. About three months ago, gangs operating in Hanover Park agreed to a truce. Interfaith mediator Thohar Rodrigues said it took more than two months for the agreement to 
be reached and feared that this weekend’s incident would spoil things. “This is a personal vendetta between the two guys; it does not come as a command from the gang leaders.” Rodrigues said that after hearing of the murder, the interfaith leaders went to visit the leaders of both gangs and were reassured that the treaty had not been broken. “I will not lie to you it is very tense here. Ground soldiers (gang members) have the impression that blood has been taken from their own camp, but we are hoping that the leaders will calm them. “There is fear that this could spark a gang war.” Another community leader, who did not want to be named, said the Laughing Boys and the Ghetto Boys were alliance partners. He said that when the gangs were at war with the Americans - a notorious Cape Flats gang - the two groups were in cahoots and fought side by side. “It is very tense, everyone is on high alert, we even have high police visibility, but as we all know police can’t cover all areas in Hanover Park. “There is a fear because when these gangs are at war, they tend to sort out their thing by going for the rival gangs; they will go fight the 
Americans.” The man said the gang situation was out of hand. He said older members were coming back from prison and were now viewed as heroes 
in the community by children. He said gangsters out on parole should not be allowed back into the community.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus

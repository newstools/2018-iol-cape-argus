Since 2005, Gerry Smeda, 61, and his family have been raising funds for children’s hospitals. He said they raised R75000 for the Red Cross Hospital in 2008.  “Because we stay in Kuils River, this time we decided to raise money for a hospital that is closer. We decided on the Tygerberg Children’s Hospital. Between 2009 and 2016 we raised R102000 for both children’s hospitals. In 2015 we also raised R15000 for the Douglas Murray House in Retreat.   Smeda’s family recently handed over the R30000 to the Tygerberg Children’s Hospital. “The money will go towards the trauma and intensive care unit at the hospital. We have been doing this because we want to help the children. It is great to see the happy smiles on their faces,” he said.  Every year they family raise the money by turning their house in Kuils River into a “Santa House”. “There is a huge structure which looks like a helicopter on the top of our house. It has been a big attraction and every year people visit it over the Christmas holidays. Decorating the house takes me about two weeks. After the decorations, we put the Tygerberg Hospital donation tins outside for people to put their donations into. So as people visit the Santa House they also put their donations in the tins. We handed 20 of these tins filled with money to Tygerberg Hospital. In 2010 we also collected R30000,” Smeda said.           Over the Christmas holidays the Smeda  family also held a Christmas party for about 500 kids in Kalkfontein near Kuils River. “The children thoroughly enjoyed it. For some it was the only special meal they had for the entire year,” he said.   Cape Argus
